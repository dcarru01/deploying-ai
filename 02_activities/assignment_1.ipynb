Conclusion: Bridging the GenAI Divide \\n2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nDespite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \\nresult in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \\ndivided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \\nconsultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \\nmillions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \\ndivide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \\ndetermined by approach.   \\nTools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \\nexplored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \\nprimarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\\ngrade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \\norganizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \\npercent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \\nand misalignment with day-to-day operations. \\nFrom our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \\nemerged that define the GenAI Divide: \\n• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \\n• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \\n• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \\n• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \\ninternal builds \\n \\nThe core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \\nGenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \\nA small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \\nlimitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \\nevaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\\npg. 4 \\n \\nsystems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \\nthese expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \\nWhile most implementations don\\'t drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \\ncrossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \\nsupport, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\\nperforming organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \\nexternal agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \\nretention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \\nsystems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \\nspecific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring. \\n \\n3 THE WRONG SIDE OF THE GENAI DIVIDE: HIGH ADOPTION, \\nLOW TRANSFORMATION \\nTakeaway: Most organizations fall on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, adoption is high, \\nbut disruption is low. Seven of nine sectors show little structural change. Enterprises are \\npiloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \\nused, but custom solutions stall due to integration complexity and lack of fit with existing \\nworkflows. \\nThe GenAI Divide is most visible when examining industry-level transformation patterns. \\nDespite high-profile investment and widespread pilot activity, only a small fraction of \\norganizations have moved beyond experimentation to achieve meaningful business \\ntransformation. \\n3.1 THE DISRUPTION REALITY BEHIND THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: The GenAI Divide manifests clearly at the industry level, despite GenAI\\'s \\nvisibility, only two industries (Tech and Media) show clear signs of structural disruption, \\nwhile seven others remain on the wrong side of transformation. \\nDespite high-profile investment, industry-level transformation remains limited. GenAI has \\nbeen embedded in support, content creation, and analytics use cases, but few industries \\nshow the deep structural shifts associated with past general-purpose technologies such as \\nnew market leaders, disrupted business models, or measurable changes in customer \\nbehavior. \\nTo better quantify the state of disruption, we developed a composite AI Market Disruption \\nIndex. Each industry was scored from 0 to 5 based on five observable indicators. These \\nscores represent normalized averages across five dimensions, triangulated from public \\nindicators and interview-derived assessments. Alternative weighting schemes were tested \\nto confirm consistency of industry rankings: \\n1. Market share volatility among top incumbents (2022 to 2025)\\npg. 5 \\n \\n2. Revenue growth of AI-native firms founded after 2020 \\n3. Emergence of new AI-driven business models \\n4. Changes in user behavior attributable to GenAI \\n5. Frequency of executive org changes attributed to AI tooling \\nExhibit: GenAI disruption varies sharply by industry \\n \\nExhibit: Description of GenAI disruption \\nIndustry Key Signals \\nTechnology New challengers gaining ground (e.g., Cursor vs Copilot); shifts in \\nworkflows \\nMedia & Telecom Rise of AI-native content; shifting ad dynamics; incumbents still \\ngrowing \\nProfessional Services Efficiency gains; client delivery remains largely unchanged \\nHealthcare & Pharma Documentation/transcription pilots; clinical models unchanged \\nConsumer & Retail Support automation; limited impact on loyalty or leaders \\nFinancial Services Backend automation; customer relationships stable \\nAdvanced Industries Maintenance pilots; no major supply chain shifts \\nEnergy & Materials Near-zero adoption; minimal experimentation \\n \\n2\\n1.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0\\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\\nMedia & Telecom\\nProfessional Services\\nHealthcare & Pharma\\nConsumer & Retail\\nFinancial Services\\nAdvanced Industries\\nEnergy & Materials\\npg. 6 \\n \\nSensitivity Analysis: We tested alternative weightings for the five disruption indicators. \\nTechnology and Media & Telecom maintained top rankings across all reasonable weighting \\nschemes, while Healthcare and Energy remained consistently low. Professional Services \\nshowed the most sensitivity to weighting changes, ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 depending on \\nemphasis placed on efficiency gains versus structural change. \\nSeven out of nine major sectors showed significant pilot activity but little to no structural \\nchange. This gap between investment and disruption directly demonstrates the GenAI \\nDivide at scale, widespread experimentation without transformation. \\nInterviewees were blunt in their assessments. One mid-market manufacturing COO \\nsummarized the prevailing sentiment: \\n\"The hype on LinkedIn says everything has changed, but in our operations, nothing \\nfundamental has shifted. We\\'re processing some contracts faster, but that\\'s all that has \\nchanged.\" \\n3.2 THE PILOT-TO-PRODUCTION CHASM \\nTakeaway: The GenAI Divide is starkest in deployment rates, only 5% of custom enterprise \\nAI tools reach production. Chatbots succeed because they\\'re easy to try and flexible, but fail \\nin critical workflows due to lack of memory and customization. This fundamental gap \\nexplains why most organizations remain on the wrong side of the divide. \\nOur research reveals a steep drop-off between investigations of GenAI adoption tools and \\npilots and actual implementations, with significant variation between generic and custom \\nsolutions. \\nResearch Limitations: These figures are directionally accurate based on individual \\ninterviews rather than official company reporting. Sample sizes vary by category, and \\nsuccess definitions may differ across organizations. \\nExhibit: The steep drop from pilots to production for task-specific GenAI tools reveals \\nthe GenAI divide \\n \\n80%\\n50%\\n40%\\n60%\\n20% 5%\\nInvestigated Piloted Successfully Implemented\\nGeneral-Purpose LLMs Embedded or Task-Specific GenAI\\npg. 7 \\n \\nResearch Note: We define successfully implemented for task-specific GenAI tools as ones \\nusers or executives have remarked as causing a marked and sustained productivity and/or \\nP&L impact \\nThe 95% failure rate for enterprise AI solutions represents the clearest manifestation of the \\nGenAI Divide. Organizations stuck on the wrong side continue investing in static tools that \\ncan\\'t adapt to their workflows, while those crossing the divide focus on learning-capable \\nsystems. \\nGeneric LLM chatbots appear to show high pilot-to-implementation rates (~83%). However, \\nthis masks a deeper split in perceived value and reveals why most organizations remain \\ntrapped on the wrong side of the divide. \\nIn interviews, enterprise users reported consistently positive experiences with consumer-\\ngrade tools like ChatGPT and Copilot. These systems were praised for flexibility, familiarity, \\nand immediate utility. Yet the same users were overwhelmingly skeptical of custom or \\nvendor-pitched AI tools, describing them as brittle, overengineered, or misaligned with \\nactual workflows. \\nAs one CIO put it, \"We\\'ve seen dozens of demos this year. Maybe one or two are genuinely \\nuseful. The rest are wrappers or science projects.\" \\nWhile enthusiasm and budgets are often sufficient to launch pilots, converting these into \\nworkflow-integrated systems with persistent value remains rare, a pattern that defines the \\nexperience of organizations on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide. \\nEnterprises, defined here as firms with over $100 million in annual revenue, lead in pilot \\ncount and allocate more staff to AI-related initiatives. Yet this intensity has not translated \\ninto success. These organizations report the lowest rates of pilot-to-scale conversion. \\nBy contrast, mid-market companies moved faster and more decisively. Top performers \\nreported average timelines of 90 days from pilot to full implementation. Enterprises, by \\ncomparison, took nine months or longer. \\n \\nFive Myths About GenAI in the Enterprise \\n1. AI Will Replace Most Jobs in the Next Few Years → Research found limited \\nlayoffs from GenAI, and only in industries that are already affected \\nsignificantly by AI. There is no consensus among executives as to hiring \\nlevels over the next 3-5 years. \\n2. Generative AI is Transforming Business → Adoption is high, but \\ntransformation is rare. Only 5% of enterprises have AI tools integrated in \\nworkflows at scale and 7 of 9 sectors show no real structural change. \\n3. Enterprises are slow in adopting new tech → Enterprises are extremely eager \\nto adopt AI and 90% have seriously explored buying an AI solution.\\npg. 8 \\n \\n4. The biggest thing holding back AI is model quality, legal, data, risk → What\\'s \\nreally holding it back is that most AI tools don\\'t learn and don’t integrate \\nwell into workflows. \\n5. The best enterprises are building their own tools → Internal builds fail twice as \\noften.  \\n \\n3.3 THE SHADOW AI ECONOMY: A BRIDGE ACROSS THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: While official enterprise initiatives remain stuck on the wrong side of the GenAI \\nDivide, employees are already crossing it through personal AI tools. This \"shadow AI\" often \\ndelivers better ROI than formal initiatives and reveals what actually works for bridging the \\ndivide. \\nBehind the disappointing enterprise deployment numbers lies a surprising reality: AI is \\nalready transforming work, just not through official channels. Our research uncovered a \\nthriving \"shadow AI economy\" where employees use personal ChatGPT accounts, Claude \\nsubscriptions, and other consumer tools to automate significant portions of their jobs, often \\nwithout IT knowledge or approval. \\nThe scale is remarkable. While only 40% of companies say they purchased an official LLM \\nsubscription, workers from over 90% of the companies we surveyed reported regular use of \\npersonal AI tools for work tasks. In fact, almost every single person used an LLM in some \\nform for their work. \\nExhibit: the shadow AI economy, employee usage far outpaces official adoption\\n \\nIn many cases, shadow AI users reported using LLMs multiples times a day every day of \\ntheir weekly workload through personal tools, while their companies\\' official AI initiatives \\nremained stalled in pilot phase. \\nThis shadow economy demonstrates that individuals can successfully cross the GenAI \\nDivide when given access to flexible, responsive tools. The organizations that recognize this \\npattern and build on it represent the future of enterprise AI adoption. \\nForward-thinking organizations are beginning to bridge this gap by learning from shadow \\nusage and analyzing which personal tools deliver value before procuring enterprise \\nalternatives. \\nEmployees who use LLMs regularly, 90%\\nCompanies who have purchased LLM subscription, 40%\\npg. 9 \\n \\n3.4 INVESTMENT PATTERNS REFLECT THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: Investment allocation reveals the GenAI Divide in action, 50% of GenAI budgets \\ngo to sales and marketing, but back-office automation often yields better ROI. This bias \\nreflects easier metric attribution, not actual value, and keeps organizations focused on the \\nwrong priorities. \\nIn terms of functional focus, investment in GenAI tools is heavily concentrated. As GenAI \\nspend is not yet formally quantified across organizations, we asked executives to allocate a \\nhypothetical $100 to different functions. Sales and marketing functions captured \\napproximately 70 percent of AI budget allocation across organizations in our survey. \\nExhibit: GenAI Investment Distribution by Function \\n \\nAI-generated outbound emails\\nSmart lead \\nscoring\\nPersonalized content for \\ncampaigns\\nFollow-up \\nautomation\\nAI-based competitor \\nanalysis\\nSocial sentiment \\nanalysis\\nInternal workflow \\norchestration\\nDocument \\nsummarization\\nDynamic resource \\nallocation\\nProcess \\ncompliance \\nmonitoring\\nCall summarization \\nand routing\\nAI-\\npowered \\nchatbots\\nSmart \\nticket \\nrouting\\nContract \\nclassification and \\ntagging\\nSupplier \\nrisk alerts\\nAP/AR \\nautomati\\non\\nSales & Marketing Operations\\nCustomer Service Finance & \\nProcurement\\npg. 10 \\n \\nResearch Notes: While the general functional allocation of GenAI investment (e.g., ~50% to \\nSales & Marketing) was relatively consistent across executive interviews, the sub-category and \\nuse-case breakdowns should be treated as directional at best. Subcategories reflect \\nsynthesized notes and anecdotal patterns, rather than precise accounting. Company type \\ndrives significant variation. For example, manufacturers and healthcare providers typically \\ndirected minimal investment to Sales & Marketing and over-indexed on Operations. Tech and \\nmedia firms often prioritized Marketing, Content, and Developer Productivity. Professional \\nservices leaned toward Document Automation and Legal/Compliance tools. \\nSales and marketing dominate not only because of visibility, but because outcomes can be \\nmeasured easily. Metrics such as demo volume or email response time align directly with \\nboard-level KPIs. \\nLegal, procurement, and finance functions, in contrast, offer more subtle efficiencies. These \\ninclude fewer compliance violations, streamlined workflows, or accelerated month-end \\nprocesses, important but hard to surface in executive conversations or investor updates. \\nA VP of Procurement at a Fortune 1000 pharmaceutical company expressed this challenge \\nclearly: \\n\"If I buy a tool to help my team work faster, how do I quantify that impact? How do I justify it to \\nmy CEO when it won\\'t directly move revenue or decrease measurable costs? I could argue it \\nhelps our scientists get their tools faster, but that\\'s several degrees removed from bottom-line \\nimpact.\" \\nThis investment bias perpetuates the GenAI Divide by directing resources toward visible but \\noften less transformative use cases, while the highest-ROI opportunities in back-office \\nfunctions remain underfunded. \\nBeyond measurement challenges, trust and social proof remain decisive in purchase \\ndecisions. A Head of Procurement at a major CPG firm captured the dilemma many buyers \\nface: \\n\"I receive numerous emails daily claiming to offer the best GenAI solution. Some have \\nimpressive demos, but establishing trust is the real challenge. With so many options flooding \\nour inbox, we rely heavily on peer recommendations and referrals from our network.\" \\nThis highlights a broader pattern: product quality alone is rarely sufficient. Referrals, prior \\nrelationships, and VC introductions remain stronger predictors of enterprise adoption than \\nfunctionality or feature set. \\n4 WHY PILOTS STALL: THE LEARNING GAP BEHIND THE DIVIDE \\nThe primary factor keeping organizations on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide is the \\nlearning gap, tools that don\\'t learn, integrate poorly, or match workflows. Users prefer \\nChatGPT for simple tasks, but abandon it for mission-critical work due to its lack of memory. \\nWhat\\'s missing is systems that adapt, remember, and evolve, capabilities that define the \\ndifference between the two sides of the divide.\\npg. 11 \\n \\n4.1 THE BARRIERS KEEPING ORGANIZATIONS TRAPPED \\nTakeaway: The top barriers reflect the fundamental learning gap that defines the GenAI \\nDivide: users resist tools that don\\'t adapt, model quality fails without context, and UX suffers \\nwhen systems can\\'t remember. Even avid ChatGPT users distrust internal GenAI tools that \\ndon\\'t match their expectations. \\nTo understand why so few GenAI pilots progress beyond the experimental phase, we \\nsurveyed both executive sponsors and frontline users across 52 organizations. Participants \\nwere asked to rate common barriers to scale on a 1–10 frequency scale, where 10 \\nrepresented the most frequently encountered obstacles. \\nThe results revealed a predictable leader: resistance to adopting new tools. However, the \\nsecond-highest barrier proved more significant than anticipated. \\nExhibit: Why GenAI pilots fail: top barriers to scaling AI in the enterprise \\nUsers were asked to rate each issue on a scale of 1-10 \\n \\nResearch Note: These scores reflect reported frequency rather than objective \\nmeasurement of barrier impact, and may vary significantly by industry and organization size. \\nThe prominence of model quality concerns initially appeared counterintuitive. Consumer \\nadoption of ChatGPT and similar tools has surged, with over 40% of knowledge workers \\nusing AI tools personally. Yet the same users who integrate these tools into personal \\nworkflows describe them as unreliable when encountered within enterprise systems. This \\nparadox illustrates the GenAI Divide at the user level.  \\nThis preference reveals a fundamental tension. The same professionals using ChatGPT daily \\nfor personal tasks demand learning and memory capabilities for enterprise work. A \\nsignificant number of workers already use AI tools privately, reporting productivity gains, \\nwhile their companies\\' formal AI initiatives stall. This shadow usage creates a feedback loop: \\nemployees know what good AI feels like, making them less tolerant of static enterprise \\ntools. \\nUnwillingness to adopt new tools\\nModel output quality concerns\\nPoor user experience\\nLack of executive sponsorship\\nChallenging change management\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\npg. 12 \\n \\n4.2 WHY GENERIC TOOLS WIN, AND LOSE \\nTakeaway: The GenAI Divide manifests in user preferences: ChatGPT beats enterprise tools \\nbecause it\\'s better, faster, and more familiar, even when both use similar models. But this \\nsame preference exposes why organizations remain stuck on the wrong side of the divide. \\nOur follow-up interviews revealed a striking contradiction. The professionals expressing \\nskepticism about enterprise AI tools were often heavy users of consumer LLM interfaces. \\nWhen asked to compare their experiences, three consistent themes emerged. \\nUser Preference Drivers: Generic LLM Interface vs. Integrated Tool \\n \\nA corporate lawyer at a mid-sized firm exemplified this dynamic. Her organization invested \\n$50,000 in a specialized contract analysis tool, yet she consistently defaulted to ChatGPT \\nfor drafting work: \\n\"Our purchased AI tool provided rigid summaries with limited customization options. With \\nChatGPT, I can guide the conversation and iterate until I get exactly what I need. The \\nfundamental quality difference is noticeable, ChatGPT consistently produces better outputs, \\neven though our vendor claims to use the same underlying technology.\" \\nThis pattern suggests that a $20-per-month general-purpose tool often outperforms \\nbespoke enterprise systems costing orders of magnitude more, at least in terms of \\nimmediate usability and user satisfaction. This paradox exemplifies why most organizations \\nremain on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide. \\n4.3 THE LEARNING GAP THAT DEFINES THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: ChatGPT\\'s very limitations reveal the core issue behind the GenAI Divide: it \\nforgets context, doesn\\'t learn, and can\\'t evolve. For mission-critical work, 90% of users \\nprefer humans. The gap is structural, GenAI lacks memory and adaptability. \\nGiven users\\' preference for consumer LLM interfaces, we investigated what prevents \\nbroader adoption for mission-critical work. The barriers here proved distinct from general \\nusability concerns and directly illuminated the learning gap that defines the GenAI Divide. \\nExhibit: Barriers to core workflow integration \\n\"The answers are better\"\\n\"Already familiar with the interface\"\\n\"Trust it more\"\\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\\npg. 13 \\n \\n \\nThe same lawyer who favored ChatGPT for initial drafts drew a clear line at sensitive \\ncontracts: \\n\"It\\'s excellent for brainstorming and first drafts, but it doesn\\'t retain knowledge of client \\npreferences or learn from previous edits. It repeats the same mistakes and requires extensive \\ncontext input for each session. For high-stakes work, I need a system that accumulates \\nknowledge and improves over time.\" \\nThis feedback points to the fundamental learning gap that keeps organizations on the \\nwrong side of the GenAI Divide. Users appreciate the flexibility and responsiveness of \\nconsumer LLM interfaces but require the persistence and contextual awareness that \\ncurrent tools cannot provide. \\nWhen we asked enterprise users to rate different options for high-stakes work, the \\npreference hierarchy became clear: \\nExhibit: Perceived Fitness for High-Stakes Work  \\n\"Would you assign this task to AI or a junior colleague?\" \\n \\nThe results reveal that AI has already won the war for simple work, 70% prefer AI for drafting \\nemails, 65% for basic analysis. But for anything complex or long-term, humans dominate by \\n9-to-1 margins. The dividing line isn\\'t intelligence, it\\'s memory, adaptability, and learning \\ncapability, the exact characteristics that separate the two sides of the GenAI Divide. \\n\"It doesn\\'t learn from our feedback.\"\\n\"Too much manual context required each time.\"\\n\"Can\\'t customize it to our specific workflows.\"\\n\"Breaks in edge cases and doesn\\'t adapt.\"\\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%\\n70%\\n10%\\n30%\\n90%\\nQuick tasks (emails, summaries, basic analysis)\\nComplex projects (multi-week work, client\\nmanagement)\\nAI Preferred Human Preferred\\npg. 14 \\n \\nAgentic AI, the class of systems that embeds persistent memory and iterative learning by \\ndesign, directly addresses the learning gap that defines the GenAI Divide. Unlike current \\nsystems that require full context each time, agentic systems maintain persistent memory, \\nlearn from interactions, and can autonomously orchestrate complex workflows. Early \\nenterprise experiments with customer service agents that handle complete inquiries end-\\nto-end, financial processing agents that monitor and approve routine transactions, and sales \\npipeline agents that track engagement across channels demonstrate how autonomy and \\nmemory address the core gaps enterprises identify. \\n \\nExhibit: Positioning GenAI tools by customization and learning capability \\n Low Memory / Learning High Memory / Learning \\nLow Customization Copilot, GPT wrappers ChatGPT w/ memory (beta) \\nHigh Customization Internal builds (fragile) Agentic workflows, vertical SaaS \\n5 CROSSING THE GENAI DIVIDE: HOW THE BEST BUILDERS \\nSUCCEED \\nOrganizations on the right side of the GenAI Divide share a common approach: they build \\nadaptive, embedded systems that learn from feedback. The best startups crossing the \\ndivide focus on narrow but high-value use cases, integrate deeply into workflows, and scale \\nthrough continuous learning rather than broad feature sets. Domain fluency and workflow \\nintegration matter more than flashy UX. \\nAcross our interviews, we observed a growing divergence among GenAI startups. Some are \\nstruggling with outdated SaaS playbooks and remain trapped on the wrong side of the \\ndivide, while others are capturing enterprise attention through aggressive customization \\nand alignment with real business pain points. \\nThe appetite for GenAI tools remains high. Several startups reported signing pilots within \\ndays and reaching seven-figure revenue run rates shortly thereafter. The standout \\nperformers are not those building general-purpose tools, but those embedding themselves \\ninside workflows, adapting to context, and scaling from narrow but high-value footholds. \\nOur data reveals a clear pattern: the organizations and vendors succeeding are those \\naggressively solving for learning, memory, and workflow adaptation, while those failing are \\neither building generic tools or trying to develop capabilities internally. \\nWinning startups build systems that learn from feedback (66% of executives want this), \\nretain context (63% demand this), and customize deeply to specific workflows. They start at \\nworkflow edges with significant customization, then scale into core processes.\\npg. 15 \\n \\n5.1 WHAT ENTERPRISES ACTUALLY WANT: THE BRIDGE ACROSS THE DIVIDE \\nThe most successful vendors understand that crossing the GenAI Divide requires building \\nsystems that executives repeatedly emphasized: AI systems that do not just generate \\ncontent, but learn and improve within their environment.  \\nWhen evaluating AI tools, buyers consistently emphasized a specific set of priorities. We \\ncoded these themes across interviews to quantify how often they surfaced in procurement \\ndecisions: \\nExhibit: How executives select GenAI vendors \\nDerived from interviews and coded by category  \\n \\nExhibit: Direct quotes on executives selecting GenAI vendors \\nDerived from interviews and coded by category  \\n \\nWhat They Want Direct Quotes  \\nA vendor we (they) trust \"We\\'re more likely to wait for our existing partner to add AI \\nthan gamble on a startup.\" \\n \\nDeep understanding of our \\nworkflow \\n\"Most vendors don\\'t get how our approvals or data flows \\nwork\" \\n \\nMinimal disruption to \\ncurrent tools \\n\"If it doesn\\'t plug into Salesforce or our internal systems, no \\none\\'s going to use it.\" \\n \\nClear data boundaries \"I can\\'t risk client data mixing with someone else\\'s model, \\neven if the vendor says it\\'s fine.\" \\n \\nThe ability to improve over \\ntime \\n\"It\\'s useful the first week, but then it just repeats the same \\nmistakes.

If the AI can\\'t adapt, \\nwe\\'re back to spreadsheets.\" \\n \\nConcerns about workforce impact were far less common than anticipated. Most users \\nwelcomed automation, especially for tedious, manual tasks, as long as data remained \\nsecure and outcomes were measurable. \\nDespite conventional wisdom that enterprises resist training AI systems, most teams in our \\ninterviews expressed willingness to do so, provided the benefits were clear and guardrails \\nwere in place. \\nDespite interest in AI, there is notable skepticism toward emerging vendors, especially in \\nhigh-trust or regulated workflows. Many procurement leaders told us they ignore most \\nstartup pitches, regardless of innovation. \\n\"We receive dozens of pitches daily about AI-powered procurement tools. However, our \\nestablished BPO partner already understands our policies and processes. We\\'re more likely to \\nwait for their AI-enhanced version than switch to an unknown vendor.\" , Head of Procurement, \\nGlobal CPG \\n5.2 THE WINNING PLAYBOOK FOR CROSSING THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: Startups that successfully cross the GenAI Divide land small, visible wins in \\nnarrow workflows, then expand. Tools with low setup burden and fast time-to-value \\noutperform heavy enterprise builds. Channel referrals and peer trust are key growth levers \\nfor bridging the divide. \\nThe most successful startups addressed both the desire for learning systems and the \\nskepticism around new tools by executing two strategies: \\n5.2.1 Customizing for specific workflows \\nEmbedding in non-critical or adjacent processes with significant customization, \\ndemonstrating clear value, then scaling into core workflows is critical. Tools that succeeded \\nshared two traits: low configuration burden and immediate, visible value. In contrast, tools \\nrequiring extensive enterprise customization often stalled at pilot stage. \\nSuccessful categories from our sample included: \\n• Voice AI for call summarization and routing \\n• Document automation for contracts and forms \\n• Code generation for repetitive engineering tasks \\nStruggling categories were often those involving complex internal logic, opaque decision \\nsupport, or optimization based on proprietary heuristics. These tools frequently hit adoption \\nfriction due to deep enterprise specificity. \\nSome startups have excelled by dominating small but critical workflows, especially in sales \\nand marketing, and then expanding. Top-quartile GenAI startups are reaching $1.2M in \\nannualized revenue within 6–12 months of launch.\\npg. 17 \\n \\n \\nNarrow Scope Broad Scope \\nSimple \\nExecution \\nFast wins (Spend Categorization, \\nContract Review) \\nPartial pilots (Supplier Risk \\nMonitoring) \\nComplex \\nExecution \\nEarly pilots (Negotiation Bots) Fails (Full Procurement \\nOrchestration) \\n \\n5.2.2 Leveraging referral networks \\nTo overcome trust barriers, successful startups often used channel partnerships with \\nsystem integrators, procurement referrals from board members or advisors, and distribution \\nthrough familiar enterprise marketplaces. \\nExhibit: How leaders discover GenAI solutions\\n \\n \\nExisting vendor partnerships, 20%\\nNew integrations / partner referrals, \\n15%\\nInformal peer \\nrecommendations, 13%\\nBoard member or \\nadvisor referral, 10%\\nConference demos or panels, \\n9%\\nIndustry publications or \\nwebinars, 6%\\nCold Inbound Other\\nVendor Relationships Peer Networks\\nEvents & Media Internal Processes\\npg. 18 \\n \\n5.3 THE NARROWING WINDOW TO CROSS THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: The window for crossing the GenAI Divide is rapidly closing. Enterprises are \\nlocking in learning-capable tools. Agentic AI and memory frameworks (like NANDA and \\nMCP) will define which vendors help organizations cross the divide versus remain trapped \\non the wrong side. \\nEnterprises are increasingly demanding systems that adapt over time. Microsoft 365 Copilot \\nand Dynamics 365 are incorporating persistent memory and feedback loops. OpenAI\\'s \\nChatGPT memory beta signals similar expectations in general-purpose tools. \\nStartups that act quickly to close this gap, by building adaptive agents that learn from \\nfeedback, usage, and outcomes, can establish durable product moats through both data \\nand integration depth. The window to do this is narrow. In many verticals, pilots are already \\nunderway. \\nThe infrastructure to support this transition is emerging through frameworks like Model \\nContext Protocol (MCP), Agent-to-Agent (A2A), and NANDA, which enable agent \\ninteroperability and coordination. These protocols create market competition and cost \\nefficiencies by allowing specialized agents to work together rather than requiring monolithic \\nsystems. And these frameworks form the foundation of the emerging Agentic Web, a mesh \\nof interoperable agents and protocols that replaces monolithic applications with dynamic \\ncoordination layers. \\nIn the next few quarters, several enterprises will lock in vendor relationships that will be \\nnearly impossible to unwind. This 18-month horizon reflects consensus from seventeen \\nprocurement and IT sourcing leaders we interviewed, supported by analysis of public \\nprocurement disclosures showing enterprise RFP-to-implementation cycles ranging from \\ntwo to eighteen months. Organizations investing in AI systems that learn from their data, \\nworkflows, and feedback are creating switching costs that compound monthly. \\n\"We\\'re currently evaluating five different GenAI solutions, but whichever system best learns and \\nadapts to our specific processes will ultimately win our business. Once we\\'ve invested time in \\ntraining a system to understand our workflows, the switching costs become prohibitive.\" - CIO, \\n$5B Financial Services Firm \\n6 CROSSING THE GENAI DIVIDE: HOW THE BEST BUYERS \\nSUCCEED \\nOrganizations that successfully cross the GenAI Divide approach AI procurement differently, \\nthey act like BPO clients, not SaaS customers. They demand deep customization, drive \\nadoption from the front lines, and hold vendors accountable to business metrics. The most \\nsuccessful buyers understand that crossing the divide requires partnership, not just \\npurchase. \\nAcross our interviews, one insight was clear: the most effective AI-buying organizations no \\nlonger wait for perfect use cases or central approval. Instead, they drive adoption through\\npg. 19 \\n \\ndistributed experimentation, vendor partnerships, and clear accountability. These buyers \\nare not just more eager, they are more strategically adaptive. \\nIn our sample, external partnerships with learning-capable, customized tools reached \\ndeployment ~67% of the time, compared to ~33% for internally built tools. While these \\nfigures reflect self-reported outcomes and may not account for all confounding variables, \\nthe magnitude of difference was consistent across interviewees. \\nThis gap explains why ChatGPT dominates for ad-hoc tasks but fails at critical workflows, \\nand why generic enterprise tools lose to both consumer LLMs and deeply customized \\nalternatives. \\n6.1 ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN FOR CROSSING THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: The right organizational structure is critical for crossing the GenAI Divide. \\nStrategic partnerships are twice as likely to succeed as internal builds. Success depends \\nless on resources and more on decentralizing authority with clear ownership. \\nThe dominant barrier to crossing the GenAI Divide is not integration or budget, it is \\norganizational design. Our data shows that companies succeed when they decentralize \\nimplementation authority but retain accountability. \\nWe observed three primary team structures for GenAI implementation, with materially \\ndifferent outcomes that reflect which side of the divide organizations land on. \\n % of Deployments  \\nStrategic \\nPartnerships \\n(Buy) \\n██████████████████████ 66% Procure external tools, co-\\ndevelop with vendors \\nInternal \\nDevelopment \\n(Build) \\n████████████ 33% Build and maintain GenAI tools \\nfully in-house \\nHybrid (Build-\\nBuy) Insufficient data to quantify Internal team co-develops with \\nan external vendor \\nResearch Limitations: These percentages reflect our interview sample of 52 organizations and \\nmay not represent broader market patterns. Success definitions varied across organizations, \\nand observation periods may not capture long-term implementation trends. \\nImportant Limitation: These success rate differences may reflect organizational capabilities \\nrather than implementation approach alone. Organizations choosing external partnerships \\nmay have different risk tolerance, procurement sophistication, or internal technical capacity \\nthan those building internally. The correlation between external partnerships and success does \\nnot necessarily prove causation. \\nStrategic partnerships achieved a significantly higher share of successful deployments than \\ninternal development efforts. While we observed far more BUILD initiatives than BUY \\ninitiatives in our sample, with many more organizations exploring internal development, the\\npg. 20 \\n \\nsuccess rates favored external partnerships. Though we lack precise data on total initiative \\nvolumes, the pattern suggests that internal development efforts have substantially lower \\nsuccess rates despite being more commonly attempted. \\nWhile organizations often combined approaches, pilots built via strategic partnerships were \\n2x as likely to reach full deployment as those built internally. More strikingly, employee \\nusage rates were nearly double for externally built tools. \\nThese partnerships often provided faster time-to-value, lower total cost, and better \\nalignment with operational workflows. Companies avoided the overhead of building from \\nscratch, while still achieving tailored solutions. Organizations that understand this pattern \\nposition themselves to cross the GenAI Divide more effectively. \\n6.2 BUYER PRACTICES THAT CROSS THE DIVIDE \\nAcross interviews, a consistent pattern emerged among organizations successfully crossing \\nthe GenAI Divide: top buyers treated AI startups less like software vendors and more like \\nbusiness service providers, holding them to benchmarks closer to those used for consulting \\nfirms or BPOs. These organizations: \\n• Demanded deep customization aligned to internal processes and data \\n• Benchmarked tools on operational outcomes, not model benchmarks \\n• Partnered through early-stage failures, treating deployment as co-evolution \\n• Sourced AI initiatives from frontline managers, not central labs \\nIn this last pattern, individual contributors and team managers often played a critical role. \\nMany of the strongest enterprise deployments began with power users, employees who \\nhad already experimented with tools like ChatGPT or Claude for personal productivity. \\nThese \"prosumers\" intuitively understood GenAI\\'s capabilities and limits, and became early \\nchampions of internally sanctioned solutions. Rather than relying on a centralized AI \\nfunction to identify use cases, successful organizations allowed budget holders and domain \\nmanagers to surface problems, vet tools, and lead rollouts. This bottom-up sourcing, paired \\nwith executive accountability, accelerated adoption while preserving operational fit. \\n6.3 WHERE THE REAL ROI LIVES: BEYOND THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: Organizations that cross the GenAI Divide discover that ROI is often highest in \\nignored functions like operations and finance. Real gains come from replacing BPOs and \\nexternal agencies, not cutting internal staff. Front-office tools get attention, but back-office \\ntools deliver savings. \\nDespite 50% of AI budgets flowing to sales and marketing (from the theoretical estimate \\nwith executives), some of the most dramatic cost savings we documented came from back-\\noffice automation. While front-office gains are visible and board-friendly, the back-office \\ndeployments often delivered faster payback periods and clearer cost reductions. \\nBest-in-class organizations are generating measurable value across both areas: \\nFront-office wins:\\npg. 21 \\n \\n• Lead qualification speed: 40% faster \\n• Customer retention: 10% improvement through AI-powered follow-ups and \\nmessaging \\nBack-office wins: \\n• BPO elimination: $2-10M annually in customer service and document processing \\n• Agency spend reduction: 30% decrease in external creative and content costs \\n• Risk checks for financial services: $1M saved annually on outsourced risk \\nmanagement \\nNotably, these gains came without material workforce reduction. Tools accelerated work, \\nbut did not change team structures or budgets. Instead, ROI emerged from reduced \\nexternal spend, eliminating BPO contracts, cutting agency fees, and replacing expensive \\nconsultants with AI-powered internal capabilities. \\nThe pattern suggests that while sales and marketing capture the majority of attention and \\ninvestment, back-office automation may offer more dramatic and sustainable returns for \\norganizations willing to look beyond the obvious use cases and truly cross the GenAI Divide. \\n6.4 THE JOB IMPACT REALITY: WHAT CROSSING THE DIVIDE ACTUALLY MEANS \\nTakeaway: GenAI is already starting to have workforce impact and it is manifesting through \\nselective displacement of previously outsourced functions and constrained hiring patterns, \\nbut not through broad-based layoffs. Organizations that have crossed the GenAI Divide \\ndemonstrate measurable external cost reduction while slightly decreasing internal \\nheadcount. \\n6.4.1 Displacement Patterns and Organizational Strategy \\nOur analysis reveals that GenAI-driven workforce reductions concentrate in functions \\nhistorically treated as non-core business activities: customer support operations, \\nadministrative processing, and standardized development tasks. These roles exhibited \\nvulnerability prior to AI implementation due to their outsourced status and process \\nstandardization. Executives were hesitant to reveal the scope of layoffs due to AI but it was \\nbetween 5-20% of customer support operations and administrative processing work in \\nthese companies.  \\nIndustry-specific hiring expectations reveal a clear correlation with GenAI impact patterns. \\nIn sectors showing minimal structural disruption from AI, Healthcare, Energy, Advanced \\nIndustries, most executives report no current or anticipated hiring reductions over the next \\nfive years. A few executives mentioned that they could anticipate decreased hiring but \\nadmitted that they currently do not have the systems in place to accurately predict when or \\nwhere it could happen. Healthcare executives, for example, express no expectation of \\nreducing physician or clinical staff hiring. \\nConversely, in Technology and Media sectors where GenAI has demonstrated measurable \\nimpact, >80% of executives anticipate reduced hiring volumes within 24 months.\\npg. 22 \\n \\nCritical finding: This dynamic remains concentrated among advanced AI adopters, and only \\nin industries that are currently experiencing significant disruption with GenAI (tech, media). \\n6.4.2 Evolving Hiring Criteria and Skills Requirements \\nGenAI adoption creates divergent hiring strategies across organizations. While executives \\ndemonstrate no consensus regarding entry-level or general hiring volumes, they \\nconsistently emphasize AI literacy as a fundamental capability requirement. This reflects \\norganizational recognition that AI proficiency represents a competitive advantage in \\nworkflow optimization. \\n\"Our hiring strategy prioritizes candidates who demonstrate AI tool proficiency. Recent \\ngraduates often exceed experienced professionals in this capability.\" - VP of Operations, Mid-\\nMarket Manufacturing \\n6.4.3 Future Workforce Impact Projections \\nMIT\\'s Project Iceberg analysis provides quantitative context for potential automation \\nexposure: \\nCurrent automation potential: 2.27% of U.S. labor value  \\nLatent automation exposure: $2.3 trillion in labor value affecting 39 million positions \\nThis latent exposure becomes actionable as AI systems develop persistent memory, \\ncontinuous learning, and autonomous tool integration, capabilities that define crossing the \\nGenAI Divide. \\nWorkforce transformation will occur gradually rather than through discrete displacement \\nevents. Until AI systems achieve contextual adaptation and autonomous operation, \\norganizational impact will manifest through external cost optimization rather than internal \\nrestructuring. \\n6.5 BEYOND AGENTS: THE AGENTIC WEB \\nTakeaway: The next evolution beyond individual AI agents is an agentic web where \\nautonomous systems can discover, negotiate, and coordinate across the entire \\ninternet infrastructure, fundamentally changing how business processes operate. \\nThe infrastructure foundations for this transformation are already emerging through \\nprotocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent-to-Agent (A2A), and NANDA, \\nwhich enable not just agent interoperability but autonomous web navigation. In an \\nagentic web, systems will autonomously discover optimal vendors and evaluate \\nsolutions without human research, establish dynamic API integrations in real-time \\nwithout pre-built connectors, execute trustless transactions through blockchain-\\nenabled smart contracts, and develop emergent workflows that self-optimize \\nacross multiple platforms and organizational boundaries. Early experiments show \\nprocurement agents identifying new suppliers and negotiating terms independently, \\ncustomer service systems coordinating seamlessly across platforms, and content \\ncreation workflows spanning multiple providers with automated quality assurance\\npg. 23 \\n \\nand payment. This represents a fundamental shift from today\\'s human-mediated \\nbusiness processes to autonomous systems that operate across the entire internet \\necosystem, moving well beyond the current GenAI Divide to reshape how \\norganizations discover, integrate, and transact in a networked economy. \\n7 CONCLUSION: BRIDGING THE GENAI DIVIDE \\nOrganizations that successfully cross the GenAI Divide do three things differently: they buy \\nrather than build, empower line managers rather than central labs, and select tools that \\nintegrate deeply while adapting over time. The most forward-thinking organizations are \\nalready experimenting with agentic systems that can learn, remember, and act \\nautonomously within defined parameters. \\nThis transition marks not just a shift in tooling, but the emergence of an Agentic Web: a \\npersistent, interconnected layer of learning systems that collaborate across vendors, \\ndomains, and interfaces. Where today’s enterprise stack is defined by siloed SaaS tools and \\nstatic workflows, the Agentic Web replaces these with dynamic agents capable of \\nnegotiating tasks, sharing context, and coordinating action across the enterprise. \\nJust as the original Web decentralized publishing and commerce, the Agentic Web \\ndecentralizes action, moving from prompts to autonomous protocol-driven coordination. \\nSystems like NANDA, MCP, and A2A represent early infrastructure for this web, enabling \\norganizations to compose workflows not from code, but from agent capabilities and \\ninteractions. As enterprises begin locking in vendor relationships and feedback loops \\nthrough 2026, the window to cross the GenAI Divide is rapidly narrowing. The next wave of \\nadoption will be won not by the flashiest models, but by the systems that learn and \\nremember and/or by systems that are custom built for a specific process. \\nThe shift from building to buying, combined with the rise of prosumer adoption and the \\nemergence of agentic capabilities, creates unprecedented opportunities for vendors who \\ncan deliver learning-capable, deeply integrated AI systems. The organizations and vendors \\nthat recognize and act on these patterns will establish the dominant positions in the post-\\npilot AI economy, on the right side of the GenAI Divide. \\nFor organizations currently trapped on the wrong side, the path forward is clear: stop \\ninvesting in static tools that require constant prompting, start partnering with vendors who \\noffer custom systems, and focus on workflow integration over flashy demos. The GenAI \\nDivide is not permanent, but crossing it requires fundamentally different choices about \\ntechnology, partnerships, and organizational design. \\n8 APPENDIX \\n8.1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \\nProduced in collaboration with Project NANDA out of MIT: NANDA (Networked Agents \\nAnd Decentralized Architecture) builds on Anthropic\\'s Model Context Protocol (MCP) and \\nthe Google/Linux Foundation A2A to create infrastructure for distributed agent intelligence\\npg. 24 \\n \\nat scale.

      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",
      "systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \n",
      "specific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring. \n",

      "LOW TRANSFORMATION \n",
      "Takeaway: Most organizations fall on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, adoption is high, \n",
      "but disruption is low. Seven of nine sectors show little structural change. Enterprises are \n",
      "piloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \n",

      "Takeaway: The GenAI Divide manifests clearly at the industry level, despite GenAI's \n",
      "visibility, only two industries (Tech and Media) show clear signs of structural disruption, \n",
      "while seven others remain on the wrong side of transformation. \n",
      "Despite high-profile investment, industry-level transformation remains limited. GenAI has \n",

      "  - actual output: The report outlines findings from a multi-method research study on generative AI (GenAI) implementation across businesses. Despite significant investment (up to $40 billion), 95% of organizations see no return on their GenAI initiatives, revealing a stark 'GenAI Divide' where only 5% of AI pilots yield substantial value. Key patterns contributing to this divide include insufficient organizational disruption in most sectors, challenges in scaling AI tools from pilot to production, and ineffective internal builds compared to successful external partnerships. The findings suggest that the core barrier is a 'learning gap'; AI tools often lack the ability to learn from context or adapt to workflows. The analysis reveals that the majority of organizations remain stuck on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, relying on generic tools like ChatGPT that enhance productivity but fail to deliver business transformation. In contrast, organizations crossing the divide often involve adaptive builders, leveraging partnerships, demanding tailored solutions, and integrating AI more effectively into workflows. The report concludes that the path forward involves embracing learning-capable systems and shifting focus from exclusive internal development to strategic external collaborations.\n",

Crossing the GenAI Divide: How the Best Builders Succeed \\n5. Crossing the GenAI Divide: How the Best Buyers Succeed \\n6. Conclusion: Bridging the GenAI Divide \\n2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nDespite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \\nresult in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \\ndivided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \\nconsultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \\nmillions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \\ndivide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \\ndetermined by approach.   \\nTools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \\nexplored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \\nprimarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\\ngrade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \\norganizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \\npercent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \\nand misalignment with day-to-day operations. \\nFrom our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \\nemerged that define the GenAI Divide: \\n• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \\n• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \\n• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \\n• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \\ninternal builds \\n \\nThe core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \\nGenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \\nA small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \\nlimitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \\nevaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\\npg. 4 \\n \\nsystems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \\nthese expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \\nWhile most implementations don\\'t drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \\ncrossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \\nsupport, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\\nperforming organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \\nexternal agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \\nretention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \\nsystems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \\nspecific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring. \\n \\n3 THE WRONG SIDE OF THE GENAI DIVIDE: HIGH ADOPTION, \\nLOW TRANSFORMATION \\nTakeaway: Most organizations fall on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, adoption is high, \\nbut disruption is low. Seven of nine sectors show little structural change. Enterprises are \\npiloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \\nused, but custom solutions stall due to integration complexity and lack of fit with existing \\nworkflows. \\nThe GenAI Divide is most visible when examining industry-level transformation patterns. \\nDespite high-profile investment and widespread pilot activity, only a small fraction of \\norganizations have moved beyond experimentation to achieve meaningful business \\ntransformation. \\n3.1 THE DISRUPTION REALITY BEHIND THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: The GenAI Divide manifests clearly at the industry level, despite GenAI\\'s \\nvisibility, only two industries (Tech and Media) show clear signs of structural disruption, \\nwhile seven others remain on the wrong side of transformation. \\nDespite high-profile investment, industry-level transformation remains limited. GenAI has \\nbeen embedded in support, content creation, and analytics use cases, but few industries \\nshow the deep structural shifts associated with past general-purpose technologies such as \\nnew market leaders, disrupted business models, or measurable changes in customer \\nbehavior. \\nTo better quantify the state of disruption, we developed a composite AI Market Disruption \\nIndex. Each industry was scored from 0 to 5 based on five observable indicators. These \\nscores represent normalized averages across five dimensions, triangulated from public \\nindicators and interview-derived assessments. Alternative weighting schemes were tested \\nto confirm consistency of industry rankings: \\n1. Market share volatility among top incumbents (2022 to 2025)\\npg. 5 \\n \\n2. Revenue growth of AI-native firms founded after 2020 \\n3. Emergence of new AI-driven business models \\n4. Changes in user behavior attributable to GenAI \\n5. Frequency of executive org changes attributed to AI tooling \\nExhibit: GenAI disruption varies sharply by industry \\n \\nExhibit: Description of GenAI disruption \\nIndustry Key Signals \\nTechnology New challengers gaining ground (e.g., Cursor vs Copilot); shifts in \\nworkflows \\nMedia & Telecom Rise of AI-native content; shifting ad dynamics; incumbents still \\ngrowing \\nProfessional Services Efficiency gains; client delivery remains largely unchanged \\nHealthcare & Pharma Documentation/transcription pilots; clinical models unchanged \\nConsumer & Retail Support automation; limited impact on loyalty or leaders \\nFinancial Services Backend automation; customer relationships stable \\nAdvanced Industries Maintenance pilots; no major supply chain shifts \\nEnergy & Materials Near-zero adoption; minimal experimentation \\n \\n2\\n1.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0\\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\\nMedia & Telecom\\nProfessional Services\\nHealthcare & Pharma\\nConsumer & Retail\\nFinancial Services\\nAdvanced Industries\\nEnergy & Materials\\npg. 6 \\n \\nSensitivity Analysis: We tested alternative weightings for the five disruption indicators. \\nTechnology and Media & Telecom maintained top rankings across all reasonable weighting \\nschemes, while Healthcare and Energy remained consistently low. Professional Services \\nshowed the most sensitivity to weighting changes, ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 depending on \\nemphasis placed on efficiency gains versus structural change. \\nSeven out of nine major sectors showed significant pilot activity but little to no structural \\nchange. This gap between investment and disruption directly demonstrates the GenAI \\nDivide at scale, widespread experimentation without transformation. \\nInterviewees were blunt in their assessments. One mid-market manufacturing COO \\nsummarized the prevailing sentiment: \\n\"The hype on LinkedIn says everything has changed, but in our operations, nothing \\nfundamental has shifted. We\\'re processing some contracts faster, but that\\'s all that has \\nchanged.\" \\n3.2 THE PILOT-TO-PRODUCTION CHASM \\nTakeaway: The GenAI Divide is starkest in deployment rates, only 5% of custom enterprise \\nAI tools reach production. Chatbots succeed because they\\'re easy to try and flexible, but fail \\nin critical workflows due to lack of memory and customization. This fundamental gap \\nexplains why most organizations remain on the wrong side of the divide. \\nOur research reveals a steep drop-off between investigations of GenAI adoption tools and \\npilots and actual implementations, with significant variation between generic and custom \\nsolutions. \\nResearch Limitations: These figures are directionally accurate based on individual \\ninterviews rather than official company reporting. Sample sizes vary by category, and \\nsuccess definitions may differ across organizations. \\nExhibit: The steep drop from pilots to production for task-specific GenAI tools reveals \\nthe GenAI divide \\n \\n80%\\n50%\\n40%\\n60%\\n20% 5%\\nInvestigated Piloted Successfully Implemented\\nGeneral-Purpose LLMs Embedded or Task-Specific GenAI\\npg. 7 \\n \\nResearch Note: We define successfully implemented for task-specific GenAI tools as ones \\nusers or executives have remarked as causing a marked and sustained productivity and/or \\nP&L impact \\nThe 95% failure rate for enterprise AI solutions represents the clearest manifestation of the \\nGenAI Divide. Organizations stuck on the wrong side continue investing in static tools that \\ncan\\'t adapt to their workflows, while those crossing the divide focus on learning-capable \\nsystems. \\nGeneric LLM chatbots appear to show high pilot-to-implementation rates (~83%). However, \\nthis masks a deeper split in perceived value and reveals why most organizations remain \\ntrapped on the wrong side of the divide. \\nIn interviews, enterprise users reported consistently positive experiences with consumer-\\ngrade tools like ChatGPT and Copilot. These systems were praised for flexibility, familiarity, \\nand immediate utility. Yet the same users were overwhelmingly skeptical of custom or \\nvendor-pitched AI tools, describing them as brittle, overengineered, or misaligned with \\nactual workflows. \\nAs one CIO put it, \"We\\'ve seen dozens of demos this year. Maybe one or two are genuinely \\nuseful. The rest are wrappers or science projects.\" \\nWhile enthusiasm and budgets are often sufficient to launch pilots, converting these into \\nworkflow-integrated systems with persistent value remains rare, a pattern that defines the \\nexperience of organizations on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide. \\nEnterprises, defined here as firms with over $100 million in annual revenue, lead in pilot \\ncount and allocate more staff to AI-related initiatives. Yet this intensity has not translated \\ninto success. These organizations report the lowest rates of pilot-to-scale conversion. \\nBy contrast, mid-market companies moved faster and more decisively. Top performers \\nreported average timelines of 90 days from pilot to full implementation. Enterprises, by \\ncomparison, took nine months or longer. \\n \\nFive Myths About GenAI in the Enterprise \\n1. AI Will Replace Most Jobs in the Next Few Years → Research found limited \\nlayoffs from GenAI, and only in industries that are already affected \\nsignificantly by AI. There is no consensus among executives as to hiring \\nlevels over the next 3-5 years. \\n2. Generative AI is Transforming Business → Adoption is high, but \\ntransformation is rare. Only 5% of enterprises have AI tools integrated in \\nworkflows at scale and 7 of 9 sectors show no real structural change. \\n3. Enterprises are slow in adopting new tech → Enterprises are extremely eager \\nto adopt AI and 90% have seriously explored buying an AI solution.\\npg. 8 \\n \\n4. The biggest thing holding back AI is model quality, legal, data, risk → What\\'s \\nreally holding it back is that most AI tools don\\'t learn and don’t integrate \\nwell into workflows. \\n5. The best enterprises are building their own tools → Internal builds fail twice as \\noften.  \\n \\n3.3 THE SHADOW AI ECONOMY: A BRIDGE ACROSS THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: While official enterprise initiatives remain stuck on the wrong side of the GenAI \\nDivide, employees are already crossing it through personal AI tools. This \"shadow AI\" often \\ndelivers better ROI than formal initiatives and reveals what actually works for bridging the \\ndivide. \\nBehind the disappointing enterprise deployment numbers lies a surprising reality: AI is \\nalready transforming work, just not through official channels. Our research uncovered a \\nthriving \"shadow AI economy\" where employees use personal ChatGPT accounts, Claude \\nsubscriptions, and other consumer tools to automate significant portions of their jobs, often \\nwithout IT knowledge or approval. \\nThe scale is remarkable. While only 40% of companies say they purchased an official LLM \\nsubscription, workers from over 90% of the companies we surveyed reported regular use of \\npersonal AI tools for work tasks. In fact, almost every single person used an LLM in some \\nform for their work. \\nExhibit: the shadow AI economy, employee usage far outpaces official adoption\\n \\nIn many cases, shadow AI users reported using LLMs multiples times a day every day of \\ntheir weekly workload through personal tools, while their companies\\' official AI initiatives \\nremained stalled in pilot phase. \\nThis shadow economy demonstrates that individuals can successfully cross the GenAI \\nDivide when given access to flexible, responsive tools. The organizations that recognize this \\npattern and build on it represent the future of enterprise AI adoption. \\nForward-thinking organizations are beginning to bridge this gap by learning from shadow \\nusage and analyzing which personal tools deliver value before procuring enterprise \\nalternatives. \\nEmployees who use LLMs regularly, 90%\\nCompanies who have purchased LLM subscription, 40%\\npg. 9 \\n \\n3.4 INVESTMENT PATTERNS REFLECT THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: Investment allocation reveals the GenAI Divide in action, 50% of GenAI budgets \\ngo to sales and marketing, but back-office automation often yields better ROI. This bias \\nreflects easier metric attribution, not actual value, and keeps organizations focused on the \\nwrong priorities. \\nIn terms of functional focus, investment in GenAI tools is heavily concentrated. As GenAI \\nspend is not yet formally quantified across organizations, we asked executives to allocate a \\nhypothetical $100 to different functions. Sales and marketing functions captured \\napproximately 70 percent of AI budget allocation across organizations in our survey. \\nExhibit: GenAI Investment Distribution by Function \\n \\nAI-generated outbound emails\\nSmart lead \\nscoring\\nPersonalized content for \\ncampaigns\\nFollow-up \\nautomation\\nAI-based competitor \\nanalysis\\nSocial sentiment \\nanalysis\\nInternal workflow \\norchestration\\nDocument \\nsummarization\\nDynamic resource \\nallocation\\nProcess \\ncompliance \\nmonitoring\\nCall summarization \\nand routing\\nAI-\\npowered \\nchatbots\\nSmart \\nticket \\nrouting\\nContract \\nclassification and \\ntagging\\nSupplier \\nrisk alerts\\nAP/AR \\nautomati\\non\\nSales & Marketing Operations\\nCustomer Service Finance & \\nProcurement\\npg. 10 \\n \\nResearch Notes: While the general functional allocation of GenAI investment (e.g., ~50% to \\nSales & Marketing) was relatively consistent across executive interviews, the sub-category and \\nuse-case breakdowns should be treated as directional at best. Subcategories reflect \\nsynthesized notes and anecdotal patterns, rather than precise accounting. Company type \\ndrives significant variation. For example, manufacturers and healthcare providers typically \\ndirected minimal investment to Sales & Marketing and over-indexed on Operations. Tech and \\nmedia firms often prioritized Marketing, Content, and Developer Productivity. Professional \\nservices leaned toward Document Automation and Legal/Compliance tools. \\nSales and marketing dominate not only because of visibility, but because outcomes can be \\nmeasured easily. Metrics such as demo volume or email response time align directly with \\nboard-level KPIs. \\nLegal, procurement, and finance functions, in contrast, offer more subtle efficiencies. These \\ninclude fewer compliance violations, streamlined workflows, or accelerated month-end \\nprocesses, important but hard to surface in executive conversations or investor updates. \\nA VP of Procurement at a Fortune 1000 pharmaceutical company expressed this challenge \\nclearly: \\n\"If I buy a tool to help my team work faster, how do I quantify that impact? How do I justify it to \\nmy CEO when it won\\'t directly move revenue or decrease measurable costs? I could argue it \\nhelps our scientists get their tools faster, but that\\'s several degrees removed from bottom-line \\nimpact.\" \\nThis investment bias perpetuates the GenAI Divide by directing resources toward visible but \\noften less transformative use cases, while the highest-ROI opportunities in back-office \\nfunctions remain underfunded. \\nBeyond measurement challenges, trust and social proof remain decisive in purchase \\ndecisions. A Head of Procurement at a major CPG firm captured the dilemma many buyers \\nface: \\n\"I receive numerous emails daily claiming to offer the best GenAI solution. Some have \\nimpressive demos, but establishing trust is the real challenge. With so many options flooding \\nour inbox, we rely heavily on peer recommendations and referrals from our network.\" \\nThis highlights a broader pattern: product quality alone is rarely sufficient. Referrals, prior \\nrelationships, and VC introductions remain stronger predictors of enterprise adoption than \\nfunctionality or feature set. \\n4 WHY PILOTS STALL: THE LEARNING GAP BEHIND THE DIVIDE \\nThe primary factor keeping organizations on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide is the \\nlearning gap, tools that don\\'t learn, integrate poorly, or match workflows. Users prefer \\nChatGPT for simple tasks, but abandon it for mission-critical work due to its lack of memory. \\nWhat\\'s missing is systems that adapt, remember, and evolve, capabilities that define the \\ndifference between the two sides of the divide.\\npg. 11 \\n \\n4.1 THE BARRIERS KEEPING ORGANIZATIONS TRAPPED \\nTakeaway: The top barriers reflect the fundamental learning gap that defines the GenAI \\nDivide: users resist tools that don\\'t adapt, model quality fails without context, and UX suffers \\nwhen systems can\\'t remember. Even avid ChatGPT users distrust internal GenAI tools that \\ndon\\'t match their expectations. \\nTo understand why so few GenAI pilots progress beyond the experimental phase, we \\nsurveyed both executive sponsors and frontline users across 52 organizations. Participants \\nwere asked to rate common barriers to scale on a 1–10 frequency scale, where 10 \\nrepresented the most frequently encountered obstacles. \\nThe results revealed a predictable leader: resistance to adopting new tools. However, the \\nsecond-highest barrier proved more significant than anticipated. \\nExhibit: Why GenAI pilots fail: top barriers to scaling AI in the enterprise \\nUsers were asked to rate each issue on a scale of 1-10 \\n \\nResearch Note: These scores reflect reported frequency rather than objective \\nmeasurement of barrier impact, and may vary significantly by industry and organization size. \\nThe prominence of model quality concerns initially appeared counterintuitive. Consumer \\nadoption of ChatGPT and similar tools has surged, with over 40% of knowledge workers \\nusing AI tools personally. Yet the same users who integrate these tools into personal \\nworkflows describe them as unreliable when encountered within enterprise systems. This \\nparadox illustrates the GenAI Divide at the user level.  \\nThis preference reveals a fundamental tension. The same professionals using ChatGPT daily \\nfor personal tasks demand learning and memory capabilities for enterprise work. A \\nsignificant number of workers already use AI tools privately, reporting productivity gains, \\nwhile their companies\\' formal AI initiatives stall. This shadow usage creates a feedback loop: \\nemployees know what good AI feels like, making them less tolerant of static enterprise \\ntools. \\nUnwillingness to adopt new tools\\nModel output quality concerns\\nPoor user experience\\nLack of executive sponsorship\\nChallenging change management\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\npg. 12 \\n \\n4.2 WHY GENERIC TOOLS WIN, AND LOSE \\nTakeaway: The GenAI Divide manifests in user preferences: ChatGPT beats enterprise tools \\nbecause it\\'s better, faster, and more familiar, even when both use similar models. But this \\nsame preference exposes why organizations remain stuck on the wrong side of the divide. \\nOur follow-up interviews revealed a striking contradiction. The professionals expressing \\nskepticism about enterprise AI tools were often heavy users of consumer LLM interfaces. \\nWhen asked to compare their experiences, three consistent themes emerged. \\nUser Preference Drivers: Generic LLM Interface vs. Integrated Tool \\n \\nA corporate lawyer at a mid-sized firm exemplified this dynamic. Her organization invested \\n$50,000 in a specialized contract analysis tool, yet she consistently defaulted to ChatGPT \\nfor drafting work: \\n\"Our purchased AI tool provided rigid summaries with limited customization options. With \\nChatGPT, I can guide the conversation and iterate until I get exactly what I need. The \\nfundamental quality difference is noticeable, ChatGPT consistently produces better outputs, \\neven though our vendor claims to use the same underlying technology.\" \\nThis pattern suggests that a $20-per-month general-purpose tool often outperforms \\nbespoke enterprise systems costing orders of magnitude more, at least in terms of \\nimmediate usability and user satisfaction. This paradox exemplifies why most organizations \\nremain on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide. \\n4.3 THE LEARNING GAP THAT DEFINES THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: ChatGPT\\'s very limitations reveal the core issue behind the GenAI Divide: it \\nforgets context, doesn\\'t learn, and can\\'t evolve. For mission-critical work, 90% of users \\nprefer humans. The gap is structural, GenAI lacks memory and adaptability. \\nGiven users\\' preference for consumer LLM interfaces, we investigated what prevents \\nbroader adoption for mission-critical work.

The best startups crossing the \\ndivide focus on narrow but high-value use cases, integrate deeply into workflows, and scale \\nthrough continuous learning rather than broad feature sets. Domain fluency and workflow \\nintegration matter more than flashy UX. \\nAcross our interviews, we observed a growing divergence among GenAI startups. Some are \\nstruggling with outdated SaaS playbooks and remain trapped on the wrong side of the \\ndivide, while others are capturing enterprise attention through aggressive customization \\nand alignment with real business pain points. \\nThe appetite for GenAI tools remains high. Several startups reported signing pilots within \\ndays and reaching seven-figure revenue run rates shortly thereafter. The standout \\nperformers are not those building general-purpose tools, but those embedding themselves \\ninside workflows, adapting to context, and scaling from narrow but high-value footholds. \\nOur data reveals a clear pattern: the organizations and vendors succeeding are those \\naggressively solving for learning, memory, and workflow adaptation, while those failing are \\neither building generic tools or trying to develop capabilities internally. \\nWinning startups build systems that learn from feedback (66% of executives want this), \\nretain context (63% demand this), and customize deeply to specific workflows. They start at \\nworkflow edges with significant customization, then scale into core processes.\\npg. 15 \\n \\n5.1 WHAT ENTERPRISES ACTUALLY WANT: THE BRIDGE ACROSS THE DIVIDE \\nThe most successful vendors understand that crossing the GenAI Divide requires building \\nsystems that executives repeatedly emphasized: AI systems that do not just generate \\ncontent, but learn and improve within their environment.  \\nWhen evaluating AI tools, buyers consistently emphasized a specific set of priorities. We \\ncoded these themes across interviews to quantify how often they surfaced in procurement \\ndecisions: \\nExhibit: How executives select GenAI vendors \\nDerived from interviews and coded by category  \\n \\nExhibit: Direct quotes on executives selecting GenAI vendors \\nDerived from interviews and coded by category  \\n \\nWhat They Want Direct Quotes  \\nA vendor we (they) trust \"We\\'re more likely to wait for our existing partner to add AI \\nthan gamble on a startup.\" \\n \\nDeep understanding of our \\nworkflow \\n\"Most vendors don\\'t get how our approvals or data flows \\nwork\" \\n \\nMinimal disruption to \\ncurrent tools \\n\"If it doesn\\'t plug into Salesforce or our internal systems, no \\none\\'s going to use it.\" \\n \\nClear data boundaries \"I can\\'t risk client data mixing with someone else\\'s model, \\neven if the vendor says it\\'s fine.\" \\n \\nThe ability to improve over \\ntime \\n\"It\\'s useful the first week, but then it just repeats the same \\nmistakes.

Most users \\nwelcomed automation, especially for tedious, manual tasks, as long as data remained \\nsecure and outcomes were measurable. \\nDespite conventional wisdom that enterprises resist training AI systems, most teams in our \\ninterviews expressed willingness to do so, provided the benefits were clear and guardrails \\nwere in place. \\nDespite interest in AI, there is notable skepticism toward emerging vendors, especially in \\nhigh-trust or regulated workflows. Many procurement leaders told us they ignore most \\nstartup pitches, regardless of innovation. \\n\"We receive dozens of pitches daily about AI-powered procurement tools. However, our \\nestablished BPO partner already understands our policies and processes. We\\'re more likely to \\nwait for their AI-enhanced version than switch to an unknown vendor.\" , Head of Procurement, \\nGlobal CPG \\n5.2 THE WINNING PLAYBOOK FOR CROSSING THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: Startups that successfully cross the GenAI Divide land small, visible wins in \\nnarrow workflows, then expand. Tools with low setup burden and fast time-to-value \\noutperform heavy enterprise builds. Channel referrals and peer trust are key growth levers \\nfor bridging the divide. \\nThe most successful startups addressed both the desire for learning systems and the \\nskepticism around new tools by executing two strategies: \\n5.2.1 Customizing for specific workflows \\nEmbedding in non-critical or adjacent processes with significant customization, \\ndemonstrating clear value, then scaling into core workflows is critical. Tools that succeeded \\nshared two traits: low configuration burden and immediate, visible value. In contrast, tools \\nrequiring extensive enterprise customization often stalled at pilot stage. \\nSuccessful categories from our sample included: \\n• Voice AI for call summarization and routing \\n• Document automation for contracts and forms \\n• Code generation for repetitive engineering tasks \\nStruggling categories were often those involving complex internal logic, opaque decision \\nsupport, or optimization based on proprietary heuristics. These tools frequently hit adoption \\nfriction due to deep enterprise specificity. \\nSome startups have excelled by dominating small but critical workflows, especially in sales \\nand marketing, and then expanding. Top-quartile GenAI startups are reaching $1.2M in \\nannualized revenue within 6–12 months of launch.\\npg. 17 \\n \\n \\nNarrow Scope Broad Scope \\nSimple \\nExecution \\nFast wins (Spend Categorization, \\nContract Review) \\nPartial pilots (Supplier Risk \\nMonitoring) \\nComplex \\nExecution \\nEarly pilots (Negotiation Bots) Fails (Full Procurement \\nOrchestration) \\n \\n5.2.2 Leveraging referral networks \\nTo overcome trust barriers, successful startups often used channel partnerships with \\nsystem integrators, procurement referrals from board members or advisors, and distribution \\nthrough familiar enterprise marketplaces. \\nExhibit: How leaders discover GenAI solutions\\n \\n \\nExisting vendor partnerships, 20%\\nNew integrations / partner referrals, \\n15%\\nInformal peer \\nrecommendations, 13%\\nBoard member or \\nadvisor referral, 10%\\nConference demos or panels, \\n9%\\nIndustry publications or \\nwebinars, 6%\\nCold Inbound Other\\nVendor Relationships Peer Networks\\nEvents & Media Internal Processes\\npg. 18 \\n \\n5.3 THE NARROWING WINDOW TO CROSS THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: The window for crossing the GenAI Divide is rapidly closing. Enterprises are \\nlocking in learning-capable tools. Agentic AI and memory frameworks (like NANDA and \\nMCP) will define which vendors help organizations cross the divide versus remain trapped \\non the wrong side. \\nEnterprises are increasingly demanding systems that adapt over time. Microsoft 365 Copilot \\nand Dynamics 365 are incorporating persistent memory and feedback loops. OpenAI\\'s \\nChatGPT memory beta signals similar expectations in general-purpose tools. \\nStartups that act quickly to close this gap, by building adaptive agents that learn from \\nfeedback, usage, and outcomes, can establish durable product moats through both data \\nand integration depth. The window to do this is narrow. In many verticals, pilots are already \\nunderway. \\nThe infrastructure to support this transition is emerging through frameworks like Model \\nContext Protocol (MCP), Agent-to-Agent (A2A), and NANDA, which enable agent \\ninteroperability and coordination. These protocols create market competition and cost \\nefficiencies by allowing specialized agents to work together rather than requiring monolithic \\nsystems. And these frameworks form the foundation of the emerging Agentic Web, a mesh \\nof interoperable agents and protocols that replaces monolithic applications with dynamic \\ncoordination layers. \\nIn the next few quarters, several enterprises will lock in vendor relationships that will be \\nnearly impossible to unwind. This 18-month horizon reflects consensus from seventeen \\nprocurement and IT sourcing leaders we interviewed, supported by analysis of public \\nprocurement disclosures showing enterprise RFP-to-implementation cycles ranging from \\ntwo to eighteen months. Organizations investing in AI systems that learn from their data, \\nworkflows, and feedback are creating switching costs that compound monthly. \\n\"We\\'re currently evaluating five different GenAI solutions, but whichever system best learns and \\nadapts to our specific processes will ultimately win our business. Once we\\'ve invested time in \\ntraining a system to understand our workflows, the switching costs become prohibitive.\" - CIO, \\n$5B Financial Services Firm \\n6 CROSSING THE GENAI DIVIDE: HOW THE BEST BUYERS \\nSUCCEED \\nOrganizations that successfully cross the GenAI Divide approach AI procurement differently, \\nthey act like BPO clients, not SaaS customers. They demand deep customization, drive \\nadoption from the front lines, and hold vendors accountable to business metrics. The most \\nsuccessful buyers understand that crossing the divide requires partnership, not just \\npurchase. \\nAcross our interviews, one insight was clear: the most effective AI-buying organizations no \\nlonger wait for perfect use cases or central approval. Instead, they drive adoption through\\npg. 19 \\n \\ndistributed experimentation, vendor partnerships, and clear accountability. These buyers \\nare not just more eager, they are more strategically adaptive. \\nIn our sample, external partnerships with learning-capable, customized tools reached \\ndeployment ~67% of the time, compared to ~33% for internally built tools. While these \\nfigures reflect self-reported outcomes and may not account for all confounding variables, \\nthe magnitude of difference was consistent across interviewees. \\nThis gap explains why ChatGPT dominates for ad-hoc tasks but fails at critical workflows, \\nand why generic enterprise tools lose to both consumer LLMs and deeply customized \\nalternatives. \\n6.1 ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN FOR CROSSING THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: The right organizational structure is critical for crossing the GenAI Divide. \\nStrategic partnerships are twice as likely to succeed as internal builds. Success depends \\nless on resources and more on decentralizing authority with clear ownership. \\nThe dominant barrier to crossing the GenAI Divide is not integration or budget, it is \\norganizational design. Our data shows that companies succeed when they decentralize \\nimplementation authority but retain accountability. \\nWe observed three primary team structures for GenAI implementation, with materially \\ndifferent outcomes that reflect which side of the divide organizations land on. \\n % of Deployments  \\nStrategic \\nPartnerships \\n(Buy) \\n██████████████████████ 66% Procure external tools, co-\\ndevelop with vendors \\nInternal \\nDevelopment \\n(Build) \\n████████████ 33% Build and maintain GenAI tools \\nfully in-house \\nHybrid (Build-\\nBuy) Insufficient data to quantify Internal team co-develops with \\nan external vendor \\nResearch Limitations: These percentages reflect our interview sample of 52 organizations and \\nmay not represent broader market patterns. Success definitions varied across organizations, \\nand observation periods may not capture long-term implementation trends. \\nImportant Limitation: These success rate differences may reflect organizational capabilities \\nrather than implementation approach alone. Organizations choosing external partnerships \\nmay have different risk tolerance, procurement sophistication, or internal technical capacity \\nthan those building internally. The correlation between external partnerships and success does \\nnot necessarily prove causation. \\nStrategic partnerships achieved a significantly higher share of successful deployments than \\ninternal development efforts. While we observed far more BUILD initiatives than BUY \\ninitiatives in our sample, with many more organizations exploring internal development, the\\npg. 20 \\n \\nsuccess rates favored external partnerships. Though we lack precise data on total initiative \\nvolumes, the pattern suggests that internal development efforts have substantially lower \\nsuccess rates despite being more commonly attempted. \\nWhile organizations often combined approaches, pilots built via strategic partnerships were \\n2x as likely to reach full deployment as those built internally. More strikingly, employee \\nusage rates were nearly double for externally built tools. \\nThese partnerships often provided faster time-to-value, lower total cost, and better \\nalignment with operational workflows. Companies avoided the overhead of building from \\nscratch, while still achieving tailored solutions. Organizations that understand this pattern \\nposition themselves to cross the GenAI Divide more effectively. \\n6.2 BUYER PRACTICES THAT CROSS THE DIVIDE \\nAcross interviews, a consistent pattern emerged among organizations successfully crossing \\nthe GenAI Divide: top buyers treated AI startups less like software vendors and more like \\nbusiness service providers, holding them to benchmarks closer to those used for consulting \\nfirms or BPOs. These organizations: \\n• Demanded deep customization aligned to internal processes and data \\n• Benchmarked tools on operational outcomes, not model benchmarks \\n• Partnered through early-stage failures, treating deployment as co-evolution \\n• Sourced AI initiatives from frontline managers, not central labs \\nIn this last pattern, individual contributors and team managers often played a critical role. \\nMany of the strongest enterprise deployments began with power users, employees who \\nhad already experimented with tools like ChatGPT or Claude for personal productivity. \\nThese \"prosumers\" intuitively understood GenAI\\'s capabilities and limits, and became early \\nchampions of internally sanctioned solutions. Rather than relying on a centralized AI \\nfunction to identify use cases, successful organizations allowed budget holders and domain \\nmanagers to surface problems, vet tools, and lead rollouts. This bottom-up sourcing, paired \\nwith executive accountability, accelerated adoption while preserving operational fit. \\n6.3 WHERE THE REAL ROI LIVES: BEYOND THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: Organizations that cross the GenAI Divide discover that ROI is often highest in \\nignored functions like operations and finance. Real gains come from replacing BPOs and \\nexternal agencies, not cutting internal staff. Front-office tools get attention, but back-office \\ntools deliver savings. \\nDespite 50% of AI budgets flowing to sales and marketing (from the theoretical estimate \\nwith executives), some of the most dramatic cost savings we documented came from back-\\noffice automation. While front-office gains are visible and board-friendly, the back-office \\ndeployments often delivered faster payback periods and clearer cost reductions. \\nBest-in-class organizations are generating measurable value across both areas: \\nFront-office wins:\\npg. 21 \\n \\n• Lead qualification speed: 40% faster \\n• Customer retention: 10% improvement through AI-powered follow-ups and \\nmessaging \\nBack-office wins: \\n• BPO elimination: $2-10M annually in customer service and document processing \\n• Agency spend reduction: 30% decrease in external creative and content costs \\n• Risk checks for financial services: $1M saved annually on outsourced risk \\nmanagement \\nNotably, these gains came without material workforce reduction. Tools accelerated work, \\nbut did not change team structures or budgets. Instead, ROI emerged from reduced \\nexternal spend, eliminating BPO contracts, cutting agency fees, and replacing expensive \\nconsultants with AI-powered internal capabilities. \\nThe pattern suggests that while sales and marketing capture the majority of attention and \\ninvestment, back-office automation may offer more dramatic and sustainable returns for \\norganizations willing to look beyond the obvious use cases and truly cross the GenAI Divide. \\n6.4 THE JOB IMPACT REALITY: WHAT CROSSING THE DIVIDE ACTUALLY MEANS \\nTakeaway: GenAI is already starting to have workforce impact and it is manifesting through \\nselective displacement of previously outsourced functions and constrained hiring patterns, \\nbut not through broad-based layoffs. Organizations that have crossed the GenAI Divide \\ndemonstrate measurable external cost reduction while slightly decreasing internal \\nheadcount. \\n6.4.1 Displacement Patterns and Organizational Strategy \\nOur analysis reveals that GenAI-driven workforce reductions concentrate in functions \\nhistorically treated as non-core business activities: customer support operations, \\nadministrative processing, and standardized development tasks. These roles exhibited \\nvulnerability prior to AI implementation due to their outsourced status and process \\nstandardization. Executives were hesitant to reveal the scope of layoffs due to AI but it was \\nbetween 5-20% of customer support operations and administrative processing work in \\nthese companies.  \\nIndustry-specific hiring expectations reveal a clear correlation with GenAI impact patterns. \\nIn sectors showing minimal structural disruption from AI, Healthcare, Energy, Advanced \\nIndustries, most executives report no current or anticipated hiring reductions over the next \\nfive years. A few executives mentioned that they could anticipate decreased hiring but \\nadmitted that they currently do not have the systems in place to accurately predict when or \\nwhere it could happen. Healthcare executives, for example, express no expectation of \\nreducing physician or clinical staff hiring. \\nConversely, in Technology and Media sectors where GenAI has demonstrated measurable \\nimpact, >80% of executives anticipate reduced hiring volumes within 24 months.\\npg. 22 \\n \\nCritical finding: This dynamic remains concentrated among advanced AI adopters, and only \\nin industries that are currently experiencing significant disruption with GenAI (tech, media). \\n6.4.2 Evolving Hiring Criteria and Skills Requirements \\nGenAI adoption creates divergent hiring strategies across organizations. While executives \\ndemonstrate no consensus regarding entry-level or general hiring volumes, they \\nconsistently emphasize AI literacy as a fundamental capability requirement. This reflects \\norganizational recognition that AI proficiency represents a competitive advantage in \\nworkflow optimization. \\n\"Our hiring strategy prioritizes candidates who demonstrate AI tool proficiency. Recent \\ngraduates often exceed experienced professionals in this capability.\" - VP of Operations, Mid-\\nMarket Manufacturing \\n6.4.3 Future Workforce Impact Projections \\nMIT\\'s Project Iceberg analysis provides quantitative context for potential automation \\nexposure: \\nCurrent automation potential: 2.27% of U.S. labor value  \\nLatent automation exposure: $2.3 trillion in labor value affecting 39 million positions \\nThis latent exposure becomes actionable as AI systems develop persistent memory, \\ncontinuous learning, and autonomous tool integration, capabilities that define crossing the \\nGenAI Divide. \\nWorkforce transformation will occur gradually rather than through discrete displacement \\nevents. Until AI systems achieve contextual adaptation and autonomous operation, \\norganizational impact will manifest through external cost optimization rather than internal \\nrestructuring. \\n6.5 BEYOND AGENTS: THE AGENTIC WEB \\nTakeaway: The next evolution beyond individual AI agents is an agentic web where \\nautonomous systems can discover, negotiate, and coordinate across the entire \\ninternet infrastructure, fundamentally changing how business processes operate. \\nThe infrastructure foundations for this transformation are already emerging through \\nprotocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent-to-Agent (A2A), and NANDA, \\nwhich enable not just agent interoperability but autonomous web navigation. In an \\nagentic web, systems will autonomously discover optimal vendors and evaluate \\nsolutions without human research, establish dynamic API integrations in real-time \\nwithout pre-built connectors, execute trustless transactions through blockchain-\\nenabled smart contracts, and develop emergent workflows that self-optimize \\nacross multiple platforms and organizational boundaries. Early experiments show \\nprocurement agents identifying new suppliers and negotiating terms independently, \\ncustomer service systems coordinating seamlessly across platforms, and content \\ncreation workflows spanning multiple providers with automated quality assurance\\npg. 23 \\n \\nand payment. This represents a fundamental shift from today\\'s human-mediated \\nbusiness processes to autonomous systems that operate across the entire internet \\necosystem, moving well beyond the current GenAI Divide to reshape how \\norganizations discover, integrate, and transact in a networked economy. \\n7 CONCLUSION: BRIDGING THE GENAI DIVIDE \\nOrganizations that successfully cross the GenAI Divide do three things differently: they buy \\nrather than build, empower line managers rather than central labs, and select tools that \\nintegrate deeply while adapting over time. The most forward-thinking organizations are \\nalready experimenting with agentic systems that can learn, remember, and act \\nautonomously within defined parameters. \\nThis transition marks not just a shift in tooling, but the emergence of an Agentic Web: a \\npersistent, interconnected layer of learning systems that collaborate across vendors, \\ndomains, and interfaces. Where today’s enterprise stack is defined by siloed SaaS tools and \\nstatic workflows, the Agentic Web replaces these with dynamic agents capable of \\nnegotiating tasks, sharing context, and coordinating action across the enterprise. \\nJust as the original Web decentralized publishing and commerce, the Agentic Web \\ndecentralizes action, moving from prompts to autonomous protocol-driven coordination. \\nSystems like NANDA, MCP, and A2A represent early infrastructure for this web, enabling \\norganizations to compose workflows not from code, but from agent capabilities and \\ninteractions. As enterprises begin locking in vendor relationships and feedback loops \\nthrough 2026, the window to cross the GenAI Divide is rapidly narrowing. The next wave of \\nadoption will be won not by the flashiest models, but by the systems that learn and \\nremember and/or by systems that are custom built for a specific process. \\nThe shift from building to buying, combined with the rise of prosumer adoption and the \\nemergence of agentic capabilities, creates unprecedented opportunities for vendors who \\ncan deliver learning-capable, deeply integrated AI systems. The organizations and vendors \\nthat recognize and act on these patterns will establish the dominant positions in the post-\\npilot AI economy, on the right side of the GenAI Divide. \\nFor organizations currently trapped on the wrong side, the path forward is clear: stop \\ninvesting in static tools that require constant prompting, start partnering with vendors who \\noffer custom systems, and focus on workflow integration over flashy demos. The GenAI \\nDivide is not permanent, but crossing it requires fundamentally different choices about \\ntechnology, partnerships, and organizational design. \\n8 APPENDIX \\n8.1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \\nProduced in collaboration with Project NANDA out of MIT: NANDA (Networked Agents \\nAnd Decentralized Architecture) builds on Anthropic\\'s Model Context Protocol (MCP) and \\nthe Google/Linux Foundation A2A to create infrastructure for distributed agent intelligence\\npg. 24 \\n \\nat scale.

       "   'actual_output': \"The report outlines findings from a multi-method research study on generative AI (GenAI) implementation across businesses. Despite significant investment (up to $40 billion), 95% of organizations see no return on their GenAI initiatives, revealing a stark 'GenAI Divide' where only 5% of AI pilots yield substantial value. Key patterns contributing to this divide include insufficient organizational disruption in most sectors, challenges in scaling AI tools from pilot to production, and ineffective internal builds compared to successful external partnerships. The findings suggest that the core barrier is a 'learning gap'; AI tools often lack the ability to learn from context or adapt to workflows. The analysis reveals that the majority of organizations remain stuck on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, relying on generic tools like ChatGPT that enhance productivity but fail to deliver business transformation. In contrast, organizations crossing the divide often involve adaptive builders, leveraging partnerships, demanding tailored solutions, and integrating AI more effectively into workflows. The report concludes that the path forward involves embracing learning-capable systems and shifting focus from exclusive internal development to strategic external collaborations.\",\n",

      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",
      "systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \n",
      "specific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring. \n",

      "LOW TRANSFORMATION \n",
      "Takeaway: Most organizations fall on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, adoption is high, \n",
      "but disruption is low. Seven of nine sectors show little structural change. Enterprises are \n",
      "piloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \n",

      "3.1 THE DISRUPTION REALITY BEHIND THE DIVIDE \n",
      "Takeaway: The GenAI Divide manifests clearly at the industry level, despite GenAI's \n",
      "visibility, only two industries (Tech and Media) show clear signs of structural disruption, \n",
      "while seven others remain on the wrong side of transformation. \n",
      "Despite high-profile investment, industry-level transformation remains limited. GenAI has \n",

      "trapped on the wrong side of the divide. \n",
      "In interviews, enterprise users reported consistently positive experiences with consumer-\n",
      "grade tools like ChatGPT and Copilot. These systems were praised for flexibility, familiarity, \n",

      "  - actual output: The report outlines findings from a multi-method research study on generative AI (GenAI) implementation across businesses. Despite significant investment (up to $40 billion), 95% of organizations see no return on their GenAI initiatives, revealing a stark 'GenAI Divide' where only 5% of AI pilots yield substantial value. Key patterns contributing to this divide include insufficient organizational disruption in most sectors, challenges in scaling AI tools from pilot to production, and ineffective internal builds compared to successful external partnerships. The findings suggest that the core barrier is a 'learning gap'; AI tools often lack the ability to learn from context or adapt to workflows. The analysis reveals that the majority of organizations remain stuck on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, relying on generic tools like ChatGPT that enhance productivity but fail to deliver business transformation. In contrast, organizations crossing the divide often involve adaptive builders, leveraging partnerships, demanding tailored solutions, and integrating AI more effectively into workflows. The report concludes that the path forward involves embracing learning-capable systems and shifting focus from exclusive internal development to strategic external collaborations.\n",

Conclusion: Bridging the GenAI Divide \\n2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \\nDespite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \\nresult in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \\ndivided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \\nconsultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \\nmillions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \\ndivide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \\ndetermined by approach.   \\nTools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \\nexplored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \\nprimarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\\ngrade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \\norganizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \\npercent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \\nand misalignment with day-to-day operations. \\nFrom our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \\nemerged that define the GenAI Divide: \\n• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \\n• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \\n• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \\n• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \\ninternal builds \\n \\nThe core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \\nGenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \\nA small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \\nlimitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \\nevaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\\npg. 4 \\n \\nsystems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \\nthese expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \\nWhile most implementations don\\'t drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \\ncrossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \\nsupport, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\\nperforming organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \\nexternal agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \\nretention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \\nsystems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \\nspecific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring. \\n \\n3 THE WRONG SIDE OF THE GENAI DIVIDE: HIGH ADOPTION, \\nLOW TRANSFORMATION \\nTakeaway: Most organizations fall on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, adoption is high, \\nbut disruption is low. Seven of nine sectors show little structural change. Enterprises are \\npiloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \\nused, but custom solutions stall due to integration complexity and lack of fit with existing \\nworkflows. \\nThe GenAI Divide is most visible when examining industry-level transformation patterns. \\nDespite high-profile investment and widespread pilot activity, only a small fraction of \\norganizations have moved beyond experimentation to achieve meaningful business \\ntransformation. \\n3.1 THE DISRUPTION REALITY BEHIND THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: The GenAI Divide manifests clearly at the industry level, despite GenAI\\'s \\nvisibility, only two industries (Tech and Media) show clear signs of structural disruption, \\nwhile seven others remain on the wrong side of transformation. \\nDespite high-profile investment, industry-level transformation remains limited. GenAI has \\nbeen embedded in support, content creation, and analytics use cases, but few industries \\nshow the deep structural shifts associated with past general-purpose technologies such as \\nnew market leaders, disrupted business models, or measurable changes in customer \\nbehavior. \\nTo better quantify the state of disruption, we developed a composite AI Market Disruption \\nIndex. Each industry was scored from 0 to 5 based on five observable indicators. These \\nscores represent normalized averages across five dimensions, triangulated from public \\nindicators and interview-derived assessments. Alternative weighting schemes were tested \\nto confirm consistency of industry rankings: \\n1. Market share volatility among top incumbents (2022 to 2025)\\npg. 5 \\n \\n2. Revenue growth of AI-native firms founded after 2020 \\n3. Emergence of new AI-driven business models \\n4. Changes in user behavior attributable to GenAI \\n5. Frequency of executive org changes attributed to AI tooling \\nExhibit: GenAI disruption varies sharply by industry \\n \\nExhibit: Description of GenAI disruption \\nIndustry Key Signals \\nTechnology New challengers gaining ground (e.g., Cursor vs Copilot); shifts in \\nworkflows \\nMedia & Telecom Rise of AI-native content; shifting ad dynamics; incumbents still \\ngrowing \\nProfessional Services Efficiency gains; client delivery remains largely unchanged \\nHealthcare & Pharma Documentation/transcription pilots; clinical models unchanged \\nConsumer & Retail Support automation; limited impact on loyalty or leaders \\nFinancial Services Backend automation; customer relationships stable \\nAdvanced Industries Maintenance pilots; no major supply chain shifts \\nEnergy & Materials Near-zero adoption; minimal experimentation \\n \\n2\\n1.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0\\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\\nMedia & Telecom\\nProfessional Services\\nHealthcare & Pharma\\nConsumer & Retail\\nFinancial Services\\nAdvanced Industries\\nEnergy & Materials\\npg. 6 \\n \\nSensitivity Analysis: We tested alternative weightings for the five disruption indicators. \\nTechnology and Media & Telecom maintained top rankings across all reasonable weighting \\nschemes, while Healthcare and Energy remained consistently low. Professional Services \\nshowed the most sensitivity to weighting changes, ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 depending on \\nemphasis placed on efficiency gains versus structural change. \\nSeven out of nine major sectors showed significant pilot activity but little to no structural \\nchange. This gap between investment and disruption directly demonstrates the GenAI \\nDivide at scale, widespread experimentation without transformation. \\nInterviewees were blunt in their assessments. One mid-market manufacturing COO \\nsummarized the prevailing sentiment: \\n\"The hype on LinkedIn says everything has changed, but in our operations, nothing \\nfundamental has shifted. We\\'re processing some contracts faster, but that\\'s all that has \\nchanged.\" \\n3.2 THE PILOT-TO-PRODUCTION CHASM \\nTakeaway: The GenAI Divide is starkest in deployment rates, only 5% of custom enterprise \\nAI tools reach production. Chatbots succeed because they\\'re easy to try and flexible, but fail \\nin critical workflows due to lack of memory and customization. This fundamental gap \\nexplains why most organizations remain on the wrong side of the divide. \\nOur research reveals a steep drop-off between investigations of GenAI adoption tools and \\npilots and actual implementations, with significant variation between generic and custom \\nsolutions. \\nResearch Limitations: These figures are directionally accurate based on individual \\ninterviews rather than official company reporting. Sample sizes vary by category, and \\nsuccess definitions may differ across organizations. \\nExhibit: The steep drop from pilots to production for task-specific GenAI tools reveals \\nthe GenAI divide \\n \\n80%\\n50%\\n40%\\n60%\\n20% 5%\\nInvestigated Piloted Successfully Implemented\\nGeneral-Purpose LLMs Embedded or Task-Specific GenAI\\npg. 7 \\n \\nResearch Note: We define successfully implemented for task-specific GenAI tools as ones \\nusers or executives have remarked as causing a marked and sustained productivity and/or \\nP&L impact \\nThe 95% failure rate for enterprise AI solutions represents the clearest manifestation of the \\nGenAI Divide. Organizations stuck on the wrong side continue investing in static tools that \\ncan\\'t adapt to their workflows, while those crossing the divide focus on learning-capable \\nsystems. \\nGeneric LLM chatbots appear to show high pilot-to-implementation rates (~83%). However, \\nthis masks a deeper split in perceived value and reveals why most organizations remain \\ntrapped on the wrong side of the divide. \\nIn interviews, enterprise users reported consistently positive experiences with consumer-\\ngrade tools like ChatGPT and Copilot. These systems were praised for flexibility, familiarity, \\nand immediate utility. Yet the same users were overwhelmingly skeptical of custom or \\nvendor-pitched AI tools, describing them as brittle, overengineered, or misaligned with \\nactual workflows. \\nAs one CIO put it, \"We\\'ve seen dozens of demos this year. Maybe one or two are genuinely \\nuseful. The rest are wrappers or science projects.\" \\nWhile enthusiasm and budgets are often sufficient to launch pilots, converting these into \\nworkflow-integrated systems with persistent value remains rare, a pattern that defines the \\nexperience of organizations on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide. \\nEnterprises, defined here as firms with over $100 million in annual revenue, lead in pilot \\ncount and allocate more staff to AI-related initiatives. Yet this intensity has not translated \\ninto success. These organizations report the lowest rates of pilot-to-scale conversion. \\nBy contrast, mid-market companies moved faster and more decisively. Top performers \\nreported average timelines of 90 days from pilot to full implementation. Enterprises, by \\ncomparison, took nine months or longer. \\n \\nFive Myths About GenAI in the Enterprise \\n1. AI Will Replace Most Jobs in the Next Few Years → Research found limited \\nlayoffs from GenAI, and only in industries that are already affected \\nsignificantly by AI. There is no consensus among executives as to hiring \\nlevels over the next 3-5 years. \\n2. Generative AI is Transforming Business → Adoption is high, but \\ntransformation is rare. Only 5% of enterprises have AI tools integrated in \\nworkflows at scale and 7 of 9 sectors show no real structural change. \\n3. Enterprises are slow in adopting new tech → Enterprises are extremely eager \\nto adopt AI and 90% have seriously explored buying an AI solution.\\npg. 8 \\n \\n4. The biggest thing holding back AI is model quality, legal, data, risk → What\\'s \\nreally holding it back is that most AI tools don\\'t learn and don’t integrate \\nwell into workflows. \\n5. The best enterprises are building their own tools → Internal builds fail twice as \\noften.  \\n \\n3.3 THE SHADOW AI ECONOMY: A BRIDGE ACROSS THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: While official enterprise initiatives remain stuck on the wrong side of the GenAI \\nDivide, employees are already crossing it through personal AI tools. This \"shadow AI\" often \\ndelivers better ROI than formal initiatives and reveals what actually works for bridging the \\ndivide. \\nBehind the disappointing enterprise deployment numbers lies a surprising reality: AI is \\nalready transforming work, just not through official channels. Our research uncovered a \\nthriving \"shadow AI economy\" where employees use personal ChatGPT accounts, Claude \\nsubscriptions, and other consumer tools to automate significant portions of their jobs, often \\nwithout IT knowledge or approval. \\nThe scale is remarkable. While only 40% of companies say they purchased an official LLM \\nsubscription, workers from over 90% of the companies we surveyed reported regular use of \\npersonal AI tools for work tasks. In fact, almost every single person used an LLM in some \\nform for their work. \\nExhibit: the shadow AI economy, employee usage far outpaces official adoption\\n \\nIn many cases, shadow AI users reported using LLMs multiples times a day every day of \\ntheir weekly workload through personal tools, while their companies\\' official AI initiatives \\nremained stalled in pilot phase. \\nThis shadow economy demonstrates that individuals can successfully cross the GenAI \\nDivide when given access to flexible, responsive tools. The organizations that recognize this \\npattern and build on it represent the future of enterprise AI adoption. \\nForward-thinking organizations are beginning to bridge this gap by learning from shadow \\nusage and analyzing which personal tools deliver value before procuring enterprise \\nalternatives. \\nEmployees who use LLMs regularly, 90%\\nCompanies who have purchased LLM subscription, 40%\\npg. 9 \\n \\n3.4 INVESTMENT PATTERNS REFLECT THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: Investment allocation reveals the GenAI Divide in action, 50% of GenAI budgets \\ngo to sales and marketing, but back-office automation often yields better ROI. This bias \\nreflects easier metric attribution, not actual value, and keeps organizations focused on the \\nwrong priorities. \\nIn terms of functional focus, investment in GenAI tools is heavily concentrated. As GenAI \\nspend is not yet formally quantified across organizations, we asked executives to allocate a \\nhypothetical $100 to different functions. Sales and marketing functions captured \\napproximately 70 percent of AI budget allocation across organizations in our survey. \\nExhibit: GenAI Investment Distribution by Function \\n \\nAI-generated outbound emails\\nSmart lead \\nscoring\\nPersonalized content for \\ncampaigns\\nFollow-up \\nautomation\\nAI-based competitor \\nanalysis\\nSocial sentiment \\nanalysis\\nInternal workflow \\norchestration\\nDocument \\nsummarization\\nDynamic resource \\nallocation\\nProcess \\ncompliance \\nmonitoring\\nCall summarization \\nand routing\\nAI-\\npowered \\nchatbots\\nSmart \\nticket \\nrouting\\nContract \\nclassification and \\ntagging\\nSupplier \\nrisk alerts\\nAP/AR \\nautomati\\non\\nSales & Marketing Operations\\nCustomer Service Finance & \\nProcurement\\npg. 10 \\n \\nResearch Notes: While the general functional allocation of GenAI investment (e.g., ~50% to \\nSales & Marketing) was relatively consistent across executive interviews, the sub-category and \\nuse-case breakdowns should be treated as directional at best. Subcategories reflect \\nsynthesized notes and anecdotal patterns, rather than precise accounting. Company type \\ndrives significant variation. For example, manufacturers and healthcare providers typically \\ndirected minimal investment to Sales & Marketing and over-indexed on Operations. Tech and \\nmedia firms often prioritized Marketing, Content, and Developer Productivity. Professional \\nservices leaned toward Document Automation and Legal/Compliance tools. \\nSales and marketing dominate not only because of visibility, but because outcomes can be \\nmeasured easily. Metrics such as demo volume or email response time align directly with \\nboard-level KPIs. \\nLegal, procurement, and finance functions, in contrast, offer more subtle efficiencies. These \\ninclude fewer compliance violations, streamlined workflows, or accelerated month-end \\nprocesses, important but hard to surface in executive conversations or investor updates. \\nA VP of Procurement at a Fortune 1000 pharmaceutical company expressed this challenge \\nclearly: \\n\"If I buy a tool to help my team work faster, how do I quantify that impact? How do I justify it to \\nmy CEO when it won\\'t directly move revenue or decrease measurable costs? I could argue it \\nhelps our scientists get their tools faster, but that\\'s several degrees removed from bottom-line \\nimpact.\" \\nThis investment bias perpetuates the GenAI Divide by directing resources toward visible but \\noften less transformative use cases, while the highest-ROI opportunities in back-office \\nfunctions remain underfunded. \\nBeyond measurement challenges, trust and social proof remain decisive in purchase \\ndecisions. A Head of Procurement at a major CPG firm captured the dilemma many buyers \\nface: \\n\"I receive numerous emails daily claiming to offer the best GenAI solution. Some have \\nimpressive demos, but establishing trust is the real challenge. With so many options flooding \\nour inbox, we rely heavily on peer recommendations and referrals from our network.\" \\nThis highlights a broader pattern: product quality alone is rarely sufficient. Referrals, prior \\nrelationships, and VC introductions remain stronger predictors of enterprise adoption than \\nfunctionality or feature set. \\n4 WHY PILOTS STALL: THE LEARNING GAP BEHIND THE DIVIDE \\nThe primary factor keeping organizations on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide is the \\nlearning gap, tools that don\\'t learn, integrate poorly, or match workflows. Users prefer \\nChatGPT for simple tasks, but abandon it for mission-critical work due to its lack of memory. \\nWhat\\'s missing is systems that adapt, remember, and evolve, capabilities that define the \\ndifference between the two sides of the divide.\\npg. 11 \\n \\n4.1 THE BARRIERS KEEPING ORGANIZATIONS TRAPPED \\nTakeaway: The top barriers reflect the fundamental learning gap that defines the GenAI \\nDivide: users resist tools that don\\'t adapt, model quality fails without context, and UX suffers \\nwhen systems can\\'t remember. Even avid ChatGPT users distrust internal GenAI tools that \\ndon\\'t match their expectations. \\nTo understand why so few GenAI pilots progress beyond the experimental phase, we \\nsurveyed both executive sponsors and frontline users across 52 organizations. Participants \\nwere asked to rate common barriers to scale on a 1–10 frequency scale, where 10 \\nrepresented the most frequently encountered obstacles. \\nThe results revealed a predictable leader: resistance to adopting new tools. However, the \\nsecond-highest barrier proved more significant than anticipated. \\nExhibit: Why GenAI pilots fail: top barriers to scaling AI in the enterprise \\nUsers were asked to rate each issue on a scale of 1-10 \\n \\nResearch Note: These scores reflect reported frequency rather than objective \\nmeasurement of barrier impact, and may vary significantly by industry and organization size. \\nThe prominence of model quality concerns initially appeared counterintuitive. Consumer \\nadoption of ChatGPT and similar tools has surged, with over 40% of knowledge workers \\nusing AI tools personally. Yet the same users who integrate these tools into personal \\nworkflows describe them as unreliable when encountered within enterprise systems. This \\nparadox illustrates the GenAI Divide at the user level.  \\nThis preference reveals a fundamental tension. The same professionals using ChatGPT daily \\nfor personal tasks demand learning and memory capabilities for enterprise work. A \\nsignificant number of workers already use AI tools privately, reporting productivity gains, \\nwhile their companies\\' formal AI initiatives stall. This shadow usage creates a feedback loop: \\nemployees know what good AI feels like, making them less tolerant of static enterprise \\ntools. \\nUnwillingness to adopt new tools\\nModel output quality concerns\\nPoor user experience\\nLack of executive sponsorship\\nChallenging change management\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\npg. 12 \\n \\n4.2 WHY GENERIC TOOLS WIN, AND LOSE \\nTakeaway: The GenAI Divide manifests in user preferences: ChatGPT beats enterprise tools \\nbecause it\\'s better, faster, and more familiar, even when both use similar models. But this \\nsame preference exposes why organizations remain stuck on the wrong side of the divide. \\nOur follow-up interviews revealed a striking contradiction. The professionals expressing \\nskepticism about enterprise AI tools were often heavy users of consumer LLM interfaces. \\nWhen asked to compare their experiences, three consistent themes emerged. \\nUser Preference Drivers: Generic LLM Interface vs. Integrated Tool \\n \\nA corporate lawyer at a mid-sized firm exemplified this dynamic. Her organization invested \\n$50,000 in a specialized contract analysis tool, yet she consistently defaulted to ChatGPT \\nfor drafting work: \\n\"Our purchased AI tool provided rigid summaries with limited customization options. With \\nChatGPT, I can guide the conversation and iterate until I get exactly what I need. The \\nfundamental quality difference is noticeable, ChatGPT consistently produces better outputs, \\neven though our vendor claims to use the same underlying technology.\" \\nThis pattern suggests that a $20-per-month general-purpose tool often outperforms \\nbespoke enterprise systems costing orders of magnitude more, at least in terms of \\nimmediate usability and user satisfaction. This paradox exemplifies why most organizations \\nremain on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide. \\n4.3 THE LEARNING GAP THAT DEFINES THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: ChatGPT\\'s very limitations reveal the core issue behind the GenAI Divide: it \\nforgets context, doesn\\'t learn, and can\\'t evolve. For mission-critical work, 90% of users \\nprefer humans. The gap is structural, GenAI lacks memory and adaptability. \\nGiven users\\' preference for consumer LLM interfaces, we investigated what prevents \\nbroader adoption for mission-critical work. The barriers here proved distinct from general \\nusability concerns and directly illuminated the learning gap that defines the GenAI Divide. \\nExhibit: Barriers to core workflow integration \\n\"The answers are better\"\\n\"Already familiar with the interface\"\\n\"Trust it more\"\\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\\npg. 13 \\n \\n \\nThe same lawyer who favored ChatGPT for initial drafts drew a clear line at sensitive \\ncontracts: \\n\"It\\'s excellent for brainstorming and first drafts, but it doesn\\'t retain knowledge of client \\npreferences or learn from previous edits. It repeats the same mistakes and requires extensive \\ncontext input for each session. For high-stakes work, I need a system that accumulates \\nknowledge and improves over time.\" \\nThis feedback points to the fundamental learning gap that keeps organizations on the \\nwrong side of the GenAI Divide. Users appreciate the flexibility and responsiveness of \\nconsumer LLM interfaces but require the persistence and contextual awareness that \\ncurrent tools cannot provide. \\nWhen we asked enterprise users to rate different options for high-stakes work, the \\npreference hierarchy became clear: \\nExhibit: Perceived Fitness for High-Stakes Work  \\n\"Would you assign this task to AI or a junior colleague?\" \\n \\nThe results reveal that AI has already won the war for simple work, 70% prefer AI for drafting \\nemails, 65% for basic analysis. But for anything complex or long-term, humans dominate by \\n9-to-1 margins. The dividing line isn\\'t intelligence, it\\'s memory, adaptability, and learning \\ncapability, the exact characteristics that separate the two sides of the GenAI Divide. \\n\"It doesn\\'t learn from our feedback.\"\\n\"Too much manual context required each time.\"\\n\"Can\\'t customize it to our specific workflows.\"\\n\"Breaks in edge cases and doesn\\'t adapt.\"\\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70%\\n70%\\n10%\\n30%\\n90%\\nQuick tasks (emails, summaries, basic analysis)\\nComplex projects (multi-week work, client\\nmanagement)\\nAI Preferred Human Preferred\\npg. 14 \\n \\nAgentic AI, the class of systems that embeds persistent memory and iterative learning by \\ndesign, directly addresses the learning gap that defines the GenAI Divide. Unlike current \\nsystems that require full context each time, agentic systems maintain persistent memory, \\nlearn from interactions, and can autonomously orchestrate complex workflows. Early \\nenterprise experiments with customer service agents that handle complete inquiries end-\\nto-end, financial processing agents that monitor and approve routine transactions, and sales \\npipeline agents that track engagement across channels demonstrate how autonomy and \\nmemory address the core gaps enterprises identify. \\n \\nExhibit: Positioning GenAI tools by customization and learning capability \\n Low Memory / Learning High Memory / Learning \\nLow Customization Copilot, GPT wrappers ChatGPT w/ memory (beta) \\nHigh Customization Internal builds (fragile) Agentic workflows, vertical SaaS \\n5 CROSSING THE GENAI DIVIDE: HOW THE BEST BUILDERS \\nSUCCEED \\nOrganizations on the right side of the GenAI Divide share a common approach: they build \\nadaptive, embedded systems that learn from feedback. The best startups crossing the \\ndivide focus on narrow but high-value use cases, integrate deeply into workflows, and scale \\nthrough continuous learning rather than broad feature sets. Domain fluency and workflow \\nintegration matter more than flashy UX. \\nAcross our interviews, we observed a growing divergence among GenAI startups. Some are \\nstruggling with outdated SaaS playbooks and remain trapped on the wrong side of the \\ndivide, while others are capturing enterprise attention through aggressive customization \\nand alignment with real business pain points. \\nThe appetite for GenAI tools remains high. Several startups reported signing pilots within \\ndays and reaching seven-figure revenue run rates shortly thereafter. The standout \\nperformers are not those building general-purpose tools, but those embedding themselves \\ninside workflows, adapting to context, and scaling from narrow but high-value footholds. \\nOur data reveals a clear pattern: the organizations and vendors succeeding are those \\naggressively solving for learning, memory, and workflow adaptation, while those failing are \\neither building generic tools or trying to develop capabilities internally. \\nWinning startups build systems that learn from feedback (66% of executives want this), \\nretain context (63% demand this), and customize deeply to specific workflows. They start at \\nworkflow edges with significant customization, then scale into core processes.\\npg. 15 \\n \\n5.1 WHAT ENTERPRISES ACTUALLY WANT: THE BRIDGE ACROSS THE DIVIDE \\nThe most successful vendors understand that crossing the GenAI Divide requires building \\nsystems that executives repeatedly emphasized: AI systems that do not just generate \\ncontent, but learn and improve within their environment.  \\nWhen evaluating AI tools, buyers consistently emphasized a specific set of priorities. We \\ncoded these themes across interviews to quantify how often they surfaced in procurement \\ndecisions: \\nExhibit: How executives select GenAI vendors \\nDerived from interviews and coded by category  \\n \\nExhibit: Direct quotes on executives selecting GenAI vendors \\nDerived from interviews and coded by category  \\n \\nWhat They Want Direct Quotes  \\nA vendor we (they) trust \"We\\'re more likely to wait for our existing partner to add AI \\nthan gamble on a startup.\" \\n \\nDeep understanding of our \\nworkflow \\n\"Most vendors don\\'t get how our approvals or data flows \\nwork\" \\n \\nMinimal disruption to \\ncurrent tools \\n\"If it doesn\\'t plug into Salesforce or our internal systems, no \\none\\'s going to use it.\" \\n \\nClear data boundaries \"I can\\'t risk client data mixing with someone else\\'s model, \\neven if the vendor says it\\'s fine.\" \\n \\nThe ability to improve over \\ntime \\n\"It\\'s useful the first week, but then it just repeats the same \\nmistakes.

If the AI can\\'t adapt, \\nwe\\'re back to spreadsheets.\" \\n \\nConcerns about workforce impact were far less common than anticipated. Most users \\nwelcomed automation, especially for tedious, manual tasks, as long as data remained \\nsecure and outcomes were measurable. \\nDespite conventional wisdom that enterprises resist training AI systems, most teams in our \\ninterviews expressed willingness to do so, provided the benefits were clear and guardrails \\nwere in place. \\nDespite interest in AI, there is notable skepticism toward emerging vendors, especially in \\nhigh-trust or regulated workflows. Many procurement leaders told us they ignore most \\nstartup pitches, regardless of innovation. \\n\"We receive dozens of pitches daily about AI-powered procurement tools. However, our \\nestablished BPO partner already understands our policies and processes. We\\'re more likely to \\nwait for their AI-enhanced version than switch to an unknown vendor.\" , Head of Procurement, \\nGlobal CPG \\n5.2 THE WINNING PLAYBOOK FOR CROSSING THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: Startups that successfully cross the GenAI Divide land small, visible wins in \\nnarrow workflows, then expand. Tools with low setup burden and fast time-to-value \\noutperform heavy enterprise builds. Channel referrals and peer trust are key growth levers \\nfor bridging the divide. \\nThe most successful startups addressed both the desire for learning systems and the \\nskepticism around new tools by executing two strategies: \\n5.2.1 Customizing for specific workflows \\nEmbedding in non-critical or adjacent processes with significant customization, \\ndemonstrating clear value, then scaling into core workflows is critical. Tools that succeeded \\nshared two traits: low configuration burden and immediate, visible value. In contrast, tools \\nrequiring extensive enterprise customization often stalled at pilot stage. \\nSuccessful categories from our sample included: \\n• Voice AI for call summarization and routing \\n• Document automation for contracts and forms \\n• Code generation for repetitive engineering tasks \\nStruggling categories were often those involving complex internal logic, opaque decision \\nsupport, or optimization based on proprietary heuristics. These tools frequently hit adoption \\nfriction due to deep enterprise specificity. \\nSome startups have excelled by dominating small but critical workflows, especially in sales \\nand marketing, and then expanding. Top-quartile GenAI startups are reaching $1.2M in \\nannualized revenue within 6–12 months of launch.\\npg. 17 \\n \\n \\nNarrow Scope Broad Scope \\nSimple \\nExecution \\nFast wins (Spend Categorization, \\nContract Review) \\nPartial pilots (Supplier Risk \\nMonitoring) \\nComplex \\nExecution \\nEarly pilots (Negotiation Bots) Fails (Full Procurement \\nOrchestration) \\n \\n5.2.2 Leveraging referral networks \\nTo overcome trust barriers, successful startups often used channel partnerships with \\nsystem integrators, procurement referrals from board members or advisors, and distribution \\nthrough familiar enterprise marketplaces. \\nExhibit: How leaders discover GenAI solutions\\n \\n \\nExisting vendor partnerships, 20%\\nNew integrations / partner referrals, \\n15%\\nInformal peer \\nrecommendations, 13%\\nBoard member or \\nadvisor referral, 10%\\nConference demos or panels, \\n9%\\nIndustry publications or \\nwebinars, 6%\\nCold Inbound Other\\nVendor Relationships Peer Networks\\nEvents & Media Internal Processes\\npg. 18 \\n \\n5.3 THE NARROWING WINDOW TO CROSS THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: The window for crossing the GenAI Divide is rapidly closing. Enterprises are \\nlocking in learning-capable tools. Agentic AI and memory frameworks (like NANDA and \\nMCP) will define which vendors help organizations cross the divide versus remain trapped \\non the wrong side. \\nEnterprises are increasingly demanding systems that adapt over time. Microsoft 365 Copilot \\nand Dynamics 365 are incorporating persistent memory and feedback loops. OpenAI\\'s \\nChatGPT memory beta signals similar expectations in general-purpose tools. \\nStartups that act quickly to close this gap, by building adaptive agents that learn from \\nfeedback, usage, and outcomes, can establish durable product moats through both data \\nand integration depth. The window to do this is narrow. In many verticals, pilots are already \\nunderway. \\nThe infrastructure to support this transition is emerging through frameworks like Model \\nContext Protocol (MCP), Agent-to-Agent (A2A), and NANDA, which enable agent \\ninteroperability and coordination. These protocols create market competition and cost \\nefficiencies by allowing specialized agents to work together rather than requiring monolithic \\nsystems. And these frameworks form the foundation of the emerging Agentic Web, a mesh \\nof interoperable agents and protocols that replaces monolithic applications with dynamic \\ncoordination layers. \\nIn the next few quarters, several enterprises will lock in vendor relationships that will be \\nnearly impossible to unwind. This 18-month horizon reflects consensus from seventeen \\nprocurement and IT sourcing leaders we interviewed, supported by analysis of public \\nprocurement disclosures showing enterprise RFP-to-implementation cycles ranging from \\ntwo to eighteen months. Organizations investing in AI systems that learn from their data, \\nworkflows, and feedback are creating switching costs that compound monthly. \\n\"We\\'re currently evaluating five different GenAI solutions, but whichever system best learns and \\nadapts to our specific processes will ultimately win our business. Once we\\'ve invested time in \\ntraining a system to understand our workflows, the switching costs become prohibitive.\" - CIO, \\n$5B Financial Services Firm \\n6 CROSSING THE GENAI DIVIDE: HOW THE BEST BUYERS \\nSUCCEED \\nOrganizations that successfully cross the GenAI Divide approach AI procurement differently, \\nthey act like BPO clients, not SaaS customers. They demand deep customization, drive \\nadoption from the front lines, and hold vendors accountable to business metrics. The most \\nsuccessful buyers understand that crossing the divide requires partnership, not just \\npurchase. \\nAcross our interviews, one insight was clear: the most effective AI-buying organizations no \\nlonger wait for perfect use cases or central approval. Instead, they drive adoption through\\npg. 19 \\n \\ndistributed experimentation, vendor partnerships, and clear accountability. These buyers \\nare not just more eager, they are more strategically adaptive. \\nIn our sample, external partnerships with learning-capable, customized tools reached \\ndeployment ~67% of the time, compared to ~33% for internally built tools. While these \\nfigures reflect self-reported outcomes and may not account for all confounding variables, \\nthe magnitude of difference was consistent across interviewees. \\nThis gap explains why ChatGPT dominates for ad-hoc tasks but fails at critical workflows, \\nand why generic enterprise tools lose to both consumer LLMs and deeply customized \\nalternatives. \\n6.1 ORGANIZATIONAL DESIGN FOR CROSSING THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: The right organizational structure is critical for crossing the GenAI Divide. \\nStrategic partnerships are twice as likely to succeed as internal builds. Success depends \\nless on resources and more on decentralizing authority with clear ownership. \\nThe dominant barrier to crossing the GenAI Divide is not integration or budget, it is \\norganizational design. Our data shows that companies succeed when they decentralize \\nimplementation authority but retain accountability. \\nWe observed three primary team structures for GenAI implementation, with materially \\ndifferent outcomes that reflect which side of the divide organizations land on. \\n % of Deployments  \\nStrategic \\nPartnerships \\n(Buy) \\n██████████████████████ 66% Procure external tools, co-\\ndevelop with vendors \\nInternal \\nDevelopment \\n(Build) \\n████████████ 33% Build and maintain GenAI tools \\nfully in-house \\nHybrid (Build-\\nBuy) Insufficient data to quantify Internal team co-develops with \\nan external vendor \\nResearch Limitations: These percentages reflect our interview sample of 52 organizations and \\nmay not represent broader market patterns. Success definitions varied across organizations, \\nand observation periods may not capture long-term implementation trends. \\nImportant Limitation: These success rate differences may reflect organizational capabilities \\nrather than implementation approach alone. Organizations choosing external partnerships \\nmay have different risk tolerance, procurement sophistication, or internal technical capacity \\nthan those building internally. The correlation between external partnerships and success does \\nnot necessarily prove causation. \\nStrategic partnerships achieved a significantly higher share of successful deployments than \\ninternal development efforts. While we observed far more BUILD initiatives than BUY \\ninitiatives in our sample, with many more organizations exploring internal development, the\\npg. 20 \\n \\nsuccess rates favored external partnerships. Though we lack precise data on total initiative \\nvolumes, the pattern suggests that internal development efforts have substantially lower \\nsuccess rates despite being more commonly attempted. \\nWhile organizations often combined approaches, pilots built via strategic partnerships were \\n2x as likely to reach full deployment as those built internally. More strikingly, employee \\nusage rates were nearly double for externally built tools. \\nThese partnerships often provided faster time-to-value, lower total cost, and better \\nalignment with operational workflows. Companies avoided the overhead of building from \\nscratch, while still achieving tailored solutions. Organizations that understand this pattern \\nposition themselves to cross the GenAI Divide more effectively. \\n6.2 BUYER PRACTICES THAT CROSS THE DIVIDE \\nAcross interviews, a consistent pattern emerged among organizations successfully crossing \\nthe GenAI Divide: top buyers treated AI startups less like software vendors and more like \\nbusiness service providers, holding them to benchmarks closer to those used for consulting \\nfirms or BPOs. These organizations: \\n• Demanded deep customization aligned to internal processes and data \\n• Benchmarked tools on operational outcomes, not model benchmarks \\n• Partnered through early-stage failures, treating deployment as co-evolution \\n• Sourced AI initiatives from frontline managers, not central labs \\nIn this last pattern, individual contributors and team managers often played a critical role. \\nMany of the strongest enterprise deployments began with power users, employees who \\nhad already experimented with tools like ChatGPT or Claude for personal productivity. \\nThese \"prosumers\" intuitively understood GenAI\\'s capabilities and limits, and became early \\nchampions of internally sanctioned solutions. Rather than relying on a centralized AI \\nfunction to identify use cases, successful organizations allowed budget holders and domain \\nmanagers to surface problems, vet tools, and lead rollouts. This bottom-up sourcing, paired \\nwith executive accountability, accelerated adoption while preserving operational fit. \\n6.3 WHERE THE REAL ROI LIVES: BEYOND THE DIVIDE \\nTakeaway: Organizations that cross the GenAI Divide discover that ROI is often highest in \\nignored functions like operations and finance. Real gains come from replacing BPOs and \\nexternal agencies, not cutting internal staff. Front-office tools get attention, but back-office \\ntools deliver savings. \\nDespite 50% of AI budgets flowing to sales and marketing (from the theoretical estimate \\nwith executives), some of the most dramatic cost savings we documented came from back-\\noffice automation. While front-office gains are visible and board-friendly, the back-office \\ndeployments often delivered faster payback periods and clearer cost reductions. \\nBest-in-class organizations are generating measurable value across both areas: \\nFront-office wins:\\npg. 21 \\n \\n• Lead qualification speed: 40% faster \\n• Customer retention: 10% improvement through AI-powered follow-ups and \\nmessaging \\nBack-office wins: \\n• BPO elimination: $2-10M annually in customer service and document processing \\n• Agency spend reduction: 30% decrease in external creative and content costs \\n• Risk checks for financial services: $1M saved annually on outsourced risk \\nmanagement \\nNotably, these gains came without material workforce reduction. Tools accelerated work, \\nbut did not change team structures or budgets. Instead, ROI emerged from reduced \\nexternal spend, eliminating BPO contracts, cutting agency fees, and replacing expensive \\nconsultants with AI-powered internal capabilities. \\nThe pattern suggests that while sales and marketing capture the majority of attention and \\ninvestment, back-office automation may offer more dramatic and sustainable returns for \\norganizations willing to look beyond the obvious use cases and truly cross the GenAI Divide. \\n6.4 THE JOB IMPACT REALITY: WHAT CROSSING THE DIVIDE ACTUALLY MEANS \\nTakeaway: GenAI is already starting to have workforce impact and it is manifesting through \\nselective displacement of previously outsourced functions and constrained hiring patterns, \\nbut not through broad-based layoffs. Organizations that have crossed the GenAI Divide \\ndemonstrate measurable external cost reduction while slightly decreasing internal \\nheadcount. \\n6.4.1 Displacement Patterns and Organizational Strategy \\nOur analysis reveals that GenAI-driven workforce reductions concentrate in functions \\nhistorically treated as non-core business activities: customer support operations, \\nadministrative processing, and standardized development tasks. These roles exhibited \\nvulnerability prior to AI implementation due to their outsourced status and process \\nstandardization. Executives were hesitant to reveal the scope of layoffs due to AI but it was \\nbetween 5-20% of customer support operations and administrative processing work in \\nthese companies.  \\nIndustry-specific hiring expectations reveal a clear correlation with GenAI impact patterns. \\nIn sectors showing minimal structural disruption from AI, Healthcare, Energy, Advanced \\nIndustries, most executives report no current or anticipated hiring reductions over the next \\nfive years. A few executives mentioned that they could anticipate decreased hiring but \\nadmitted that they currently do not have the systems in place to accurately predict when or \\nwhere it could happen. Healthcare executives, for example, express no expectation of \\nreducing physician or clinical staff hiring. \\nConversely, in Technology and Media sectors where GenAI has demonstrated measurable \\nimpact, >80% of executives anticipate reduced hiring volumes within 24 months.\\npg. 22 \\n \\nCritical finding: This dynamic remains concentrated among advanced AI adopters, and only \\nin industries that are currently experiencing significant disruption with GenAI (tech, media). \\n6.4.2 Evolving Hiring Criteria and Skills Requirements \\nGenAI adoption creates divergent hiring strategies across organizations. While executives \\ndemonstrate no consensus regarding entry-level or general hiring volumes, they \\nconsistently emphasize AI literacy as a fundamental capability requirement. This reflects \\norganizational recognition that AI proficiency represents a competitive advantage in \\nworkflow optimization. \\n\"Our hiring strategy prioritizes candidates who demonstrate AI tool proficiency. Recent \\ngraduates often exceed experienced professionals in this capability.\" - VP of Operations, Mid-\\nMarket Manufacturing \\n6.4.3 Future Workforce Impact Projections \\nMIT\\'s Project Iceberg analysis provides quantitative context for potential automation \\nexposure: \\nCurrent automation potential: 2.27% of U.S. labor value  \\nLatent automation exposure: $2.3 trillion in labor value affecting 39 million positions \\nThis latent exposure becomes actionable as AI systems develop persistent memory, \\ncontinuous learning, and autonomous tool integration, capabilities that define crossing the \\nGenAI Divide. \\nWorkforce transformation will occur gradually rather than through discrete displacement \\nevents. Until AI systems achieve contextual adaptation and autonomous operation, \\norganizational impact will manifest through external cost optimization rather than internal \\nrestructuring. \\n6.5 BEYOND AGENTS: THE AGENTIC WEB \\nTakeaway: The next evolution beyond individual AI agents is an agentic web where \\nautonomous systems can discover, negotiate, and coordinate across the entire \\ninternet infrastructure, fundamentally changing how business processes operate. \\nThe infrastructure foundations for this transformation are already emerging through \\nprotocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent-to-Agent (A2A), and NANDA, \\nwhich enable not just agent interoperability but autonomous web navigation. In an \\nagentic web, systems will autonomously discover optimal vendors and evaluate \\nsolutions without human research, establish dynamic API integrations in real-time \\nwithout pre-built connectors, execute trustless transactions through blockchain-\\nenabled smart contracts, and develop emergent workflows that self-optimize \\nacross multiple platforms and organizational boundaries. Early experiments show \\nprocurement agents identifying new suppliers and negotiating terms independently, \\ncustomer service systems coordinating seamlessly across platforms, and content \\ncreation workflows spanning multiple providers with automated quality assurance\\npg. 23 \\n \\nand payment. This represents a fundamental shift from today\\'s human-mediated \\nbusiness processes to autonomous systems that operate across the entire internet \\necosystem, moving well beyond the current GenAI Divide to reshape how \\norganizations discover, integrate, and transact in a networked economy. \\n7 CONCLUSION: BRIDGING THE GENAI DIVIDE \\nOrganizations that successfully cross the GenAI Divide do three things differently: they buy \\nrather than build, empower line managers rather than central labs, and select tools that \\nintegrate deeply while adapting over time. The most forward-thinking organizations are \\nalready experimenting with agentic systems that can learn, remember, and act \\nautonomously within defined parameters. \\nThis transition marks not just a shift in tooling, but the emergence of an Agentic Web: a \\npersistent, interconnected layer of learning systems that collaborate across vendors, \\ndomains, and interfaces. Where today’s enterprise stack is defined by siloed SaaS tools and \\nstatic workflows, the Agentic Web replaces these with dynamic agents capable of \\nnegotiating tasks, sharing context, and coordinating action across the enterprise. \\nJust as the original Web decentralized publishing and commerce, the Agentic Web \\ndecentralizes action, moving from prompts to autonomous protocol-driven coordination. \\nSystems like NANDA, MCP, and A2A represent early infrastructure for this web, enabling \\norganizations to compose workflows not from code, but from agent capabilities and \\ninteractions. As enterprises begin locking in vendor relationships and feedback loops \\nthrough 2026, the window to cross the GenAI Divide is rapidly narrowing. The next wave of \\nadoption will be won not by the flashiest models, but by the systems that learn and \\nremember and/or by systems that are custom built for a specific process. \\nThe shift from building to buying, combined with the rise of prosumer adoption and the \\nemergence of agentic capabilities, creates unprecedented opportunities for vendors who \\ncan deliver learning-capable, deeply integrated AI systems. The organizations and vendors \\nthat recognize and act on these patterns will establish the dominant positions in the post-\\npilot AI economy, on the right side of the GenAI Divide. \\nFor organizations currently trapped on the wrong side, the path forward is clear: stop \\ninvesting in static tools that require constant prompting, start partnering with vendors who \\noffer custom systems, and focus on workflow integration over flashy demos. The GenAI \\nDivide is not permanent, but crossing it requires fundamentally different choices about \\ntechnology, partnerships, and organizational design. \\n8 APPENDIX \\n8.1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \\nProduced in collaboration with Project NANDA out of MIT: NANDA (Networked Agents \\nAnd Decentralized Architecture) builds on Anthropic\\'s Model Context Protocol (MCP) and \\nthe Google/Linux Foundation A2A to create infrastructure for distributed agent intelligence\\npg. 24 \\n \\nat scale.

       "   'actual_output': \"The report outlines findings from a multi-method research study on generative AI (GenAI) implementation across businesses. Despite significant investment (up to $40 billion), 95% of organizations see no return on their GenAI initiatives, revealing a stark 'GenAI Divide' where only 5% of AI pilots yield substantial value. Key patterns contributing to this divide include insufficient organizational disruption in most sectors, challenges in scaling AI tools from pilot to production, and ineffective internal builds compared to successful external partnerships. The findings suggest that the core barrier is a 'learning gap'; AI tools often lack the ability to learn from context or adapt to workflows. The analysis reveals that the majority of organizations remain stuck on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, relying on generic tools like ChatGPT that enhance productivity but fail to deliver business transformation. In contrast, organizations crossing the divide often involve adaptive builders, leveraging partnerships, demanding tailored solutions, and integrating AI more effectively into workflows. The report concludes that the path forward involves embracing learning-capable systems and shifting focus from exclusive internal development to strategic external collaborations.\",\n",

      "  - actual output: The report outlines findings from a multi-method research study on generative AI (GenAI) implementation across businesses. Despite significant investment (up to $40 billion), 95% of organizations see no return on their GenAI initiatives, revealing a stark 'GenAI Divide' where only 5% of AI pilots yield substantial value. Key patterns contributing to this divide include insufficient organizational disruption in most sectors, challenges in scaling AI tools from pilot to production, and ineffective internal builds compared to successful external partnerships. The findings suggest that the core barrier is a 'learning gap'; AI tools often lack the ability to learn from context or adapt to workflows. The analysis reveals that the majority of organizations remain stuck on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, relying on generic tools like ChatGPT that enhance productivity but fail to deliver business transformation. In contrast, organizations crossing the divide often involve adaptive builders, leveraging partnerships, demanding tailored solutions, and integrating AI more effectively into workflows. The report concludes that the path forward involves embracing learning-capable systems and shifting focus from exclusive internal development to strategic external collaborations.\n",

      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",

      "  - actual output: The report outlines findings from a multi-method research study on generative AI (GenAI) implementation across businesses. Despite significant investment (up to $40 billion), 95% of organizations see no return on their GenAI initiatives, revealing a stark 'GenAI Divide' where only 5% of AI pilots yield substantial value. Key patterns contributing to this divide include insufficient organizational disruption in most sectors, challenges in scaling AI tools from pilot to production, and ineffective internal builds compared to successful external partnerships. The findings suggest that the core barrier is a 'learning gap'; AI tools often lack the ability to learn from context or adapt to workflows. The analysis reveals that the majority of organizations remain stuck on the wrong side of the GenAI Divide, relying on generic tools like ChatGPT that enhance productivity but fail to deliver business transformation. In contrast, organizations crossing the divide often involve adaptive builders, leveraging partnerships, demanding tailored solutions, and integrating AI more effectively into workflows. The report concludes that the path forward involves embracing learning-capable systems and shifting focus from exclusive internal development to strategic external collaborations.\n",

      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",
      "systems. These early results suggest that learning-capable systems, when targeted at \n",
      "specific processes, can deliver real value, even without major organizational restructuring. \n",

      "piloting GenAI tools, but very few reach deployment. Generic tools like ChatGPT are widely \n",

      "while seven others remain on the wrong side of transformation. \n",
      "Despite high-profile investment, industry-level transformation remains limited. GenAI has \n",

      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",

The investigation reveals that while tools like ChatGPT are widely adopted, they enhance individual productivity but fall short in transforming business operations or achieving measurable P&L impacts. Major barriers to scaling include brittle workflows, poor integration into existing processes, and a lack of learning capability.

      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",

      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",

The investigation reveals that while tools like ChatGPT are widely adopted, they enhance individual productivity but fall short in transforming business operations or achieving measurable P&L impacts. Major barriers to scaling include brittle workflows, poor integration into existing processes, and a lack of learning capability. Organizations exhibiting success typically demand customization, focus on specific operational contexts, and forge external partnerships to achieve greater deployment rates.\n",

      "Despite $30–40 billion in enterprise investment into GenAI, this report uncovers a surprising \n",
      "result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return. The outcomes are so starkly \n",
      "divided across both buyers (enterprises, mid-market, SMBs) and builders (startups, vendors, \n",
      "consultancies) that we call it the GenAI Divide. Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting \n",
      "millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable P&L impact. This \n",
      "divide does not seem to be driven by model quality or regulation, but seems to be \n",
      "determined by approach.   \n",
      "Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are widely adopted. Over 80 percent of organizations have \n",
      "explored or piloted them, and nearly 40 percent report deployment. But these tools \n",
      "primarily enhance individual productivity, not P&L performance. Meanwhile, enterprise-\n",
      "grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are being quietly rejected. Sixty percent of \n",
      "organizations evaluated such tools, but only 20 percent reached pilot stage and just 5 \n",
      "percent reached production. Most fail due to brittle workflows, lack of contextual learning, \n",
      "and misalignment with day-to-day operations. \n",
      "From our interviews, surveys, and analysis of 300 public implementations, four patterns \n",
      "emerged that define the GenAI Divide: \n",
      "• Limited disruption: Only 2 of 8 major sectors show meaningful structural change \n",
      "• Enterprise paradox: Big firms lead in pilot volume but lag in scale-up \n",
      "• Investment bias: Budgets favor visible, top-line functions over high-ROI back office \n",
      "• Implementation advantage: External partnerships see twice the success rate of \n",
      "internal builds \n",
      " \n",
      "The core barrier to scaling is not infrastructure, regulation, or talent. It is learning. Most \n",
      "GenAI systems do not retain feedback, adapt to context, or improve over time. \n",
      "A small group of vendors and buyers are achieving faster progress by addressing these \n",
      "limitations directly. Buyers who succeed demand process-specific customization and \n",
      "evaluate tools based on business outcomes rather than software benchmarks. They expect\n",
      "pg. 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "systems that integrate with existing processes and improve over time. Vendors meeting \n",
      "these expectations are securing multi-million-dollar deployments within months. \n",
      "While most implementations don't drive headcount reduction, organizations that have \n",
      "crossed the GenAI Divide are beginning to see selective workforce impacts in customer \n",
      "support, software engineering, and administrative functions. In addition, the highest-\n",
      "performing organizations report measurable savings from reduced BPO spending and \n",
      "external agency use, particularly in back-office operations. Others cite improved customer \n",
      "retention and sales conversion through automated outreach and intelligent follow-up \n",

The investigation reveals that while tools like ChatGPT are widely adopted, they enhance individual productivity but fall short in transforming business operations or achieving measurable P&L impacts. Major barriers to scaling include brittle workflows, poor integration into existing processes, and a lack of learning capability. Organizations exhibiting success typically demand customization, focus on specific operational contexts, and forge external partnerships to achieve greater deployment rates.\n",
